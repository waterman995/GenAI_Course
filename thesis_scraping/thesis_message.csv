DPMesh: Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Occluded Human Mesh Recovery,"Zhu, Yixuan, Li, Ao, Tang, Yansong, Zhao, Wenliang, Zhou, Jie, Lu, Jiwen",The recovery of occluded human meshes poses challenges for current methods due to the difficulty in extracting effective image features under severe occlusion. In this paper we introduce DPMesh an innovative framework for occluded human mesh recovery that capitalizes on the profound knowledge about object structure and spatial relationships embedded in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Unlike previous methods reliant on conventional backbones for vanilla feature extraction DPMesh seamlessly integrates the pre-trained denoising U-Net with potent priors as its image backbone and performs a single-step inference to provide occlusion-aware information. To enhance the perception capability for occluded poses DPMesh incorporates judicious guidance via condition injection which produces effective controls from 2D observations for the denoising U-Net. Furthermore we explore a dedicated noisy key-point reasoning approach to mitigate disturbances arising from occlusion and crowded scenarios. This strategy fully unleashes the perceptual capability of the diffusion prior thereby enhancing accuracy. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments affirm the efficacy of our framework as we outperform state-of-the-art methods on both occlusion-specific and standard datasets underscoring its ability to achieve precise and robust 3D human mesh recovery particularly in challenging scenarios involving occlusion and crowded scenes.

HEAL-SWIN: A Vision Transformer On The Sphere,"Carlsson, Oscar, Gerken, Jan E., Linander, Hampus, Spie√ü, Heiner, Ohlsson, Fredrik, Petersson, Christoffer, Persson, Daniel",High-resolution wide-angle fisheye images are becoming more and more important for robotics applications such as autonomous driving. However using ordinary convolutional neural networks or vision transformers on this data is problematic due to projection and distortion losses introduced when projecting to a rectangular grid on the plane. We introduce the HEAL-SWIN transformer which combines the highly uniform Hierarchical Equal Area iso-Latitude Pixelation (HEALPix) grid used in astrophysics and cosmology with the Hierarchical Shifted-Window (SWIN) transformer to yield an efficient and flexible model capable of training on high-resolution distortion-free spherical data. In HEAL-SWIN the nested structure of the HEALPix grid is used to perform the patching and windowing operations of the SWIN transformer enabling the network to process spherical representations with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model on both synthetic and real automotive datasets as well as a selection of other image datasets for semantic segmentation depth regression and classification tasks. Our code is publicly available.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Carlsson_HEAL-SWIN_A_Vision_Transformer_On_The_Sphere_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
3D Paintbrush: Local Stylization of 3D Shapes with Cascaded Score Distillation,"Decatur, Dale, Lang, Itai, Aberman, Kfir, Hanocka, Rana",We present 3D Paintbrush a technique for automatically texturing local semantic regions on meshes via text descriptions. Our method is designed to operate directly on meshes producing texture maps which seamlessly integrate into standard graphics pipelines. We opt to simultaneously produce a localization map (to specify the edit region) and a texture map which conforms to it. This approach improves the quality of both the localization and the stylization. To enhance the details and resolution of the textured area we leverage multiple stages of a cascaded diffusion model to supervise our local editing technique with generative priors learned from images at different resolutions. Our technique referred to as Cascaded Score Distillation (CSD) simultaneously distills scores at multiple resolutions in a cascaded fashion enabling control over both the granularity and global understanding of the supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Paintbrush to locally texture different semantic regions on a variety of shapes.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Decatur_3D_Paintbrush_Local_Stylization_of_3D_Shapes_with_Cascaded_Score_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Guided Slot Attention for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation,"Lee, Minhyeok, Cho, Suhwan, Lee, Dogyoon, Park, Chaewon, Lee, Jungho, Lee, Sangyoun",Unsupervised video object segmentation aims to segment the most prominent object in a video sequence. However the existence of complex backgrounds and multiple foreground objects make this task challenging. To address this issue we propose a guided slot attention network to reinforce spatial structural information and obtain better foreground-background separation. The foreground and background slots which are initialized with query guidance are iteratively refined based on interactions with template information. Furthermore to improve slot-template interaction and effectively fuse global and local features in the target and reference frames K-nearest neighbors filtering and a feature aggregation transformer are introduced. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets. Additionally we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model in challenging scenes through various comparative experiments.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_Guided_Slot_Attention_for_Unsupervised_Video_Object_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Programmable Motion Generation for Open-Set Motion Control Tasks,"Liu, Hanchao, Zhan, Xiaohang, Huang, Shaoli, Mu, Tai-Jiang, Shan, Ying",Character animation in real-world scenarios necessitates a variety of constraints such as trajectories key-frames interactions etc. Existing methodologies typically treat single or a finite set of these constraint(s) as separate control tasks. These methods are often specialized and the tasks they address are rarely extendable or customizable. We categorize these as solutions to the close-set motion control problem. In response to the complexity of practical motion control we propose and attempt to solve the open-set motion control problem. This problem is characterized by an open and fully customizable set of motion control tasks. To address this we introduce a new paradigm programmable motion generation. In this paradigm any given motion control task is broken down into a combination of atomic constraints. These constraints are then programmed into an error function that quantifies the degree to which a motion sequence adheres to them. We utilize a pre-trained motion generation model and optimize its latent code to minimize the error function of the generated motion. Consequently the generated motion not only inherits the prior of the generative model but also satisfies the requirements of the compounded constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate high-quality motions when addressing a wide range of unseen tasks. These tasks encompass motion control by motion dynamics geometric constraints physical laws interactions with scenes objects or the character's own body parts etc. All of these are achieved in a unified approach without the need for ad-hoc paired training data collection or specialized network designs. During the programming of novel tasks we observed the emergence of new skills beyond those of the prior model. With the assistance of large language models we also achieved automatic programming. We hope that this work will pave the way for the motion control of general AI agents.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Programmable_Motion_Generation_for_Open-Set_Motion_Control_Tasks_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SCE-MAE: Selective Correspondence Enhancement with Masked Autoencoder for Self-Supervised Landmark Estimation,"Yin, Kejia, Rao, Varshanth, Jiang, Ruowei, Liu, Xudong, Aarabi, Parham, Lindell, David B.",Self-supervised landmark estimation is a challenging task that demands the formation of locally distinct feature representations to identify sparse facial landmarks in the absence of annotated data. To tackle this task existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (1) extract coarse features from backbones that are trained with instance-level self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms which neglect the dense prediction nature of the task (2) aggregate them into memory-intensive hypercolumn formations and (3) supervise lightweight projector networks to naively establish full local correspondences among all pairs of spatial features. In this paper we introduce SCE-MAE a framework that (1) leverages the MAE [??] a region-level SSL method that naturally better suits the landmark prediction task (2) operates on the vanilla feature map instead of on expensive hypercolumns and (3) employs a Correspondence Approximation and Refinement Block (CARB) that utilizes a simple density peak clustering algorithm and our proposed Locality-Constrained Repellence Loss to directly hone only select local correspondences. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SCE-MAE is highly effective and robust outperforming existing SOTA methods by large margins of 20%-44% on the landmark matching and 9%-15% on the landmark detection tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yin_SCE-MAE_Selective_Correspondence_Enhancement_with_Masked_Autoencoder_for_Self-Supervised_Landmark_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
LAKE-RED: Camouflaged Images Generation by Latent Background Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion,"Zhao, Pancheng, Xu, Peng, Qin, Pengda, Fan, Deng-Ping, Zhang, Zhicheng, Jia, Guoli, Zhou, Bowen, Yang, Jufeng",Camouflaged vision perception is an important vision task with numerous practical applications. Due to the expensive collection and labeling costs this community struggles with a major bottleneck that the species category of its datasets is limited to a small number of object species. However the existing camouflaged generation methods require specifying the background manually thus failing to extend the camouflaged sample diversity in a low-cost manner. In this paper we propose a Latent Background Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion (LAKE-RED) for camouflaged image generation. To our knowledge our contributions mainly include: (1) For the first time we propose a camouflaged generation paradigm that does not need to receive any background inputs. (2) Our LAKE-RED is the first knowledge retrieval-augmented method with interpretability for camouflaged generation in which we propose an idea that knowledge retrieval and reasoning enhancement are separated explicitly to alleviate the task-specific challenges. Moreover our method is not restricted to specific foreground targets or backgrounds offering a potential for extending camouflaged vision perception to more diverse domains. (3) Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing approaches generating more realistic camouflage images.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhao_LAKE-RED_Camouflaged_Images_Generation_by_Latent_Background_Knowledge_Retrieval-Augmented_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
TIGER: Time-Varying Denoising Model for 3D Point Cloud Generation with Diffusion Process,"Ren, Zhiyuan, Kim, Minchul, Liu, Feng, Liu, Xiaoming",Recently diffusion models have emerged as a new powerful generative method for 3D point cloud generation tasks. However few works study the effect of the architecture of the diffusion model in the 3D point cloud resorting to the typical UNet model developed for 2D images. Inspired by the wide adoption of Transformers we study the complementary role of convolution (from UNet) and attention (from Transformers). We discover that their respective importance change according to the timestep in the diffusion process. At early stage attention has an outsized influence because Transformers are found to generate the overall shape more quickly and at later stages when adding fine detail convolution starts having a larger impact on the generated point cloud's local surface quality. In light of this observation we propose a time-varying two-stream denoising model combined with convolution layers and transformer blocks. We generate an optimizable mask from each timestep to reweigh global and local features obtaining time-varying fused features. Experimentally we demonstrate that our proposed method quantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-art methods regarding visual quality and diversity. Code is avaiable github.com/Zhiyuan-R/Tiger-Time-varying-Diffusion-Model-for-Point-Cloud-Generation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ren_TIGER_Time-Varying_Denoising_Model_for_3D_Point_Cloud_Generation_with_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ASH: Animatable Gaussian Splats for Efficient and Photoreal Human Rendering,"Pang, Haokai, Zhu, Heming, Kortylewski, Adam, Theobalt, Christian, Habermann, Marc",Real-time rendering of photorealistic and controllable human avatars stands as a cornerstone in Computer Vision and Graphics. While recent advances in neural implicit rendering have unlocked unprecedented photorealism for digital avatars real-time performance has mostly been demonstrated for static scenes only. To address this we propose ASH an animatable Gaussian splatting approach for photorealistic rendering of dynamic humans in real time. We parameterize the clothed human as animatable 3D Gaussians which can be efficiently splatted into image space to generate the final rendering. However naively learning the Gaussian parameters in 3D space poses a severe challenge in terms of compute. Instead we attach the Gaussians onto a deformable character model and learn their parameters in 2D texture space which allows leveraging efficient 2D convolutional architectures that easily scale with the required number of Gaussians. We benchmark ASH with competing methods on pose-controllable avatars demonstrating that our method outperforms existing real-time methods by a large margin and shows comparable or even better results than offline methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Pang_ASH_Animatable_Gaussian_Splats_for_Efficient_and_Photoreal_Human_Rendering_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ArtAdapter: Text-to-Image Style Transfer using Multi-Level Style Encoder and Explicit Adaptation,"Chen, Dar-Yen, Tennent, Hamish, Hsu, Ching-Wen",This work introduces ArtAdapter a transformative text-to-image (T2I) style transfer framework that transcends traditional limitations of color brushstrokes and object shape capturing high-level style elements such as composition and distinctive artistic expression. The integration of a multi-level style encoder with our proposed explicit adaptation mechanism enables ArtAdapter to achieve unprecedented fidelity in style transfer ensuring close alignment with textual descriptions. Additionally the incorporation of an Auxiliary Content Adapter (ACA) effectively separates content from style alleviating the borrowing of content from style references. Moreover our novel fast finetuning approach could further enhance zero-shot style representation while mitigating the risk of overfitting. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that ArtAdapter surpasses current state-of-the-art methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_ArtAdapter_Text-to-Image_Style_Transfer_using_Multi-Level_Style_Encoder_and_Explicit_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Activity-Biometrics: Person Identification from Daily Activities,"Azad, Shehreen, Rawat, Yogesh Singh",In this work we study a novel problem which focuses on person identification while performing daily activities. Learning biometric features from RGB videos is challenging due to spatio-temporal complexity and presence of appearance biases such as clothing color and background. We propose ABNet a novel framework which leverages disentanglement of biometric and non-biometric features to perform effective person identification from daily activities. ABNet relies on a bias-less teacher to learn biometric features from RGB videos and explicitly disentangle non-biometric features with the help of biometric distortion. In addition ABNet also exploits activity prior for biometrics which is enabled by joint biometric and activity learning. We perform comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach across five different datasets which are derived from existing activity recognition benchmarks. Furthermore we extensively compare ABNet with existing works in person identification and demonstrate its effectiveness for activity-based biometrics across all five datasets. The code and dataset can be accessed at: https://github.com/sacrcv/Activity-Biometrics/,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Azad_Activity-Biometrics_Person_Identification_from_Daily_Activities_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Z*: Zero-shot Style Transfer via Attention Reweighting,"Deng, Yingying, He, Xiangyu, Tang, Fan, Dong, Weiming",Despite the remarkable progress in image style transfer formulating style in the context of art is inherently subjective and challenging. In contrast to existing methods this study shows that vanilla diffusion models can directly extract style information and seamlessly integrate the generative prior into the content image without retraining. Specifically we adopt dual denoising paths to represent content/style references in latent space and then guide the content image denoising process with style latent codes. We further reveal that the cross-attention mechanism in latent diffusion models tends to blend the content and style images resulting in stylized outputs that deviate from the original content image. To overcome this limitation we introduce a cross-attention reweighting strategy. Through theoretical analysis and experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the diffusion-based zero-shot style transfer via attention reweighting Z-STAR.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Deng_Z_Zero-shot_Style_Transfer_via_Attention_Reweighting_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Learning Continuous 3D Words for Text-to-Image Generation,"Cheng, Ta-Ying, Gadelha, Matheus, Groueix, Thibault, Fisher, Matthew, Mech, Radomir, Markham, Andrew, Trigoni, Niki",Current controls over diffusion models (e.g. through text or ControlNet) for image generation fall short in recognizing abstract continuous attributes like illumination direction or non-rigid shape change. In this paper we present an approach for allowing users of text-to-image models to have fine-grained control of several attributes in an image. We do this by engineering special sets of input tokens that can be transformed in a continuous manner we call them Continuous 3D Words. These attributes can for example be represented as sliders and applied jointly with text prompts for fine-grained control over image generation. Given only a single mesh and a rendering engine we show that our approach can be adopted to provide continuous user control over several 3D-aware attributes including time-of-day illumination bird wing orientation dollyzoom effect and object poses. Our method is capable of conditioning image creation with multiple Continuous 3D Words and text descriptions simultaneously while adding no overhead to the generative process.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cheng_Learning_Continuous_3D_Words_for_Text-to-Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MarkovGen: Structured Prediction for Efficient Text-to-Image Generation,"Jayasumana, Sadeep, Glasner, Daniel, Ramalingam, Srikumar, Veit, Andreas, Chakrabarti, Ayan, Kumar, Sanjiv",Modern text-to-image generation models produce high-quality images that are both photorealistic and faithful to the text prompts. However this quality comes at significant computational cost: nearly all of these models are iterative and require running sampling multiple times with large models. This iterative process is needed to ensure that different regions of the image are not only aligned with the text prompt but also compatible with each other. In this work we propose a light-weight approach to achieving this compatibility between different regions of an image using a Markov Random Field (MRF) model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on top of the latent token-based Muse text-to-image model. The MRF richly encodes the compatibility among image tokens at different spatial locations to improve quality and significantly reduce the required number of Muse sampling steps. Inference with the MRF is significantly cheaper and its parameters can be quickly learned through back-propagation by modeling MRF inference as a differentiable neural-network layer. Our full model MarkovGen uses this proposed MRF model to both speed up Muse by 1.5xand produce higher quality images by decreasing undesirable image artifacts.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jayasumana_MarkovGen_Structured_Prediction_for_Efficient_Text-to-Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HashPoint: Accelerated Point Searching and Sampling for Neural Rendering,"Ma, Jiahao, Liu, Miaomiao, Ahmedt-Aristizabal, David, Nguyen, Chuong",In this paper we address the problem of efficient point searching and sampling for volume neural rendering. Within this realm two typical approaches are employed: rasterization and ray tracing. The rasterization-based methods enable real-time rendering at the cost of increased memory and lower fidelity. In contrast the ray-tracing-based methods yield superior quality but demand longer rendering time. We solve this problem by our HashPoint method combining these two strategies leveraging rasterization for efficient point searching and sampling and ray marching for rendering. Our method optimizes point searching by rasterizing points within the camera's view organizing them in a hash table and facilitating rapid searches. Notably we accelerate the rendering process by adaptive sampling on the primary surface encountered by the ray. Our approach yields substantial speed-up for a range of state-of-the-art ray-tracing-based methods maintaining equivalent or superior accuracy across synthetic and real test datasets. The code will be available at https://jiahao-ma.github.io/hashpoint/,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ma_HashPoint_Accelerated_Point_Searching_and_Sampling_for_Neural_Rendering_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MFP: Making Full Use of Probability Maps for Interactive Image Segmentation,"Lee, Chaewon, Lee, Seon-Ho, Kim, Chang-Su",In recent interactive segmentation algorithms previous probability maps are used as network input to help predictions in the current segmentation round. However despite the utilization of previous masks useful information contained in the probability maps is not well propagated to the current predictions. In this paper to overcome this limitation we propose a novel and effective algorithm for click-based interactive image segmentation called MFP which attempts to make full use of probability maps. We first modulate previous probability maps to enhance their representations of user-specified objects. Then we feed the modulated probability maps as additional input to the segmentation network. We implement the proposed MFP algorithm based on the ResNet-34 HRNet-18 and ViT-B backbones and assess the performance extensively on various datasets. It is demonstrated that MFP meaningfully outperforms the existing algorithms using identical backbones. The source codes are available at https://github.com/cwlee00/MFP.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_MFP_Making_Full_Use_of_Probability_Maps_for_Interactive_Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
StyLitGAN: Image-Based Relighting via Latent Control,"Bhattad, Anand, Soole, James, Forsyth, D.A.",We describe a novel method StyLitGAN for relighting and resurfacing images in the absence of labeled data. StyLitGAN generates images with realistic lighting effects including cast shadows soft shadows inter-reflections and glossy effects without the need for paired or CGI data. StyLitGAN uses an intrinsic image method to decompose an image followed by a search of the latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN to identify a set of directions. By prompting the model to fix one component (e.g. albedo) and vary another (e.g. shading) we generate relighted images by adding the identified directions to the latent style codes. Quantitative metrics of change in albedo and lighting diversity allow us to choose effective directions using a forward selection process. Qualitative evaluation confirms the effectiveness of our method.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bhattad_StyLitGAN_Image-Based_Relighting_via_Latent_Control_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MoMask: Generative Masked Modeling of 3D Human Motions,"Guo, Chuan, Mu, Yuxuan, Javed, Muhammad Gohar, Wang, Sen, Cheng, Li",We introduce MoMask a novel masked modeling framework for text-driven 3D human motion generation. In MoMask a hierarchical quantization scheme is employed to represent human motion as multi-layer discrete motion tokens with high-fidelity details. Starting at the base layer with a sequence of motion tokens obtained by vector quantization the residual tokens of increasing orders are derived and stored at the subsequent layers of the hierarchy. This is consequently followed by two distinct bidirectional transformers. For the base-layer motion tokens a Masked Transformer is designated to predict randomly masked motion tokens conditioned on text input at training stage. During generation (i.e. inference) stage starting from an empty sequence our Masked Transformer iteratively fills up the missing tokens; Subsequently a Residual Transformer learns to progressively predict the next-layer tokens based on the results from current layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoMask outperforms the state-of-art methods on the text-to-motion generation task with an FID of 0.045 (vs e.g. 0.141 of T2M-GPT) on the HumanML3D dataset and 0.228 (vs 0.514) on KIT-ML respectively. MoMask can also be seamlessly applied in related tasks without further model fine-tuning such as text-guided temporal inpainting.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Guo_MoMask_Generative_Masked_Modeling_of_3D_Human_Motions_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Fitting Flats to Flats,"Dogadov, Gabriel, Finnendahl, Ugo, Alexa, Marc",Affine subspaces of Euclidean spaces are also referred to as flats. A standard task in computer vision or more generally in engineering and applied sciences is fitting a flat to a set of points which is commonly solved using the PCA. We generalize this technique to enable fitting a flat to a set of other flats possibly of varying dimensions based on representing the flats as squared distance fields. Compared to previous approaches such as Riemannian centers of mass in the manifold of affine Grassmannians our approach is conceptually much simpler and computationally more efficient yet offers desirable properties such as respecting symmetries and being equivariant to rigid transformations leading to more intuitive and useful results in practice. We demonstrate these claims in a number of synthetic experiments and a multi-view reconstruction task of line-like objects.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Dogadov_Fitting_Flats_to_Flats_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Coupled Laplacian Eigenmaps for Locally-Aware 3D Rigid Point Cloud Matching,"Bastico, Matteo, Decenci√®re, Etienne, Cort√©, Laurent, Tillier, Yannick, Ryckelynck, David",Point cloud matching a crucial technique in computer vision medical and robotics fields is primarily concerned with finding correspondences between pairs of point clouds or voxels. In some practical scenarios emphasizing local differences is crucial for accurately identifying a correct match thereby enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the matching process. Commonly used shape descriptors have several limitations and often fail to provide meaningful local insights about the paired geometries. In this work we propose a new technique based on graph Laplacian eigenmaps to match point clouds by taking into account fine local structures. To deal with the order and sign ambiguity of Laplacian eigenmaps we introduce a new operator called Coupled Laplacian that allows to easily generate aligned eigenspaces for multiple registered geometries. We show that the similarity between those aligned high-dimensional spaces provides a locally meaningful score to match shapes. We firstly evaluate the performance of the proposed technique in a point-wise manner focusing on the task of object anomaly localization on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset. Additionally we define a new medical task called automatic Bone Side Estimation (BSE) which we address through a global similarity score derived from coupled eigenspaces. In order to test it we propose a benchmark collecting bone surface structures from various public datasets. Our matching technique based on Coupled Laplacian outperforms other methods by reaching an impressive accuracy on both tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bastico_Coupled_Laplacian_Eigenmaps_for_Locally-Aware_3D_Rigid_Point_Cloud_Matching_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Scaling Up Video Summarization Pretraining with Large Language Models,"Argaw, Dawit Mureja, Yoon, Seunghyun, Heilbron, Fabian Caba, Deilamsalehy, Hanieh, Bui, Trung, Wang, Zhaowen, Dernoncourt, Franck, Chung, Joon Son",Long-form video content constitutes a significant portion of internet traffic making automated video summarization an essential research problem. However existing video summarization datasets are notably limited in their size constraining the effectiveness of state-of-the-art methods for generalization. Our work aims to overcome this limitation by capitalizing on the abundance of long-form videos with dense speech-to-video alignment and the remarkable capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) in summarizing long text. We introduce an automated and scalable pipeline for generating a large-scale video summarization dataset using LLMs as Oracle summarizers. By leveraging the generated dataset we analyze the limitations of existing approaches and propose a new video summarization model that effectively addresses them. To facilitate further research in the field our work also presents a new benchmark dataset that contains 1200 long videos each with high-quality summaries annotated by professionals. Extensive experiments clearly indicate that our proposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art in video summarization across several benchmarks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Argaw_Scaling_Up_Video_Summarization_Pretraining_with_Large_Language_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Continuous Optical Zooming: A Benchmark for Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution in Real World,"Fu, Huiyuan, Peng, Fei, Li, Xianwei, Li, Yejun, Wang, Xin, Ma, Huadong",Most current arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (SR) methods has commonly relied on simulated data generated by simple synthetic degradation models (e.g. bicubic downsampling) at continuous various scales thereby falling short in capturing the complex degradation of real-world images. This limitation hinders the visual quality of these methods when applied to real-world images. To address this issue we propose the Continuous Optical Zooming dataset (COZ) by constructing an automatic imaging system to collect images at fine-grained various focal lengths within a specific range and providing strict image pair alignment. The COZ dataset serves as a benchmark to provide real-world data for training and testing arbitrary-scale SR models. To enhance the model's robustness against real-world image degradation we propose a Local Mix Implicit network (LMI) based on the MLP-mixer architecture and meta-learning which directly learns the local texture information by simultaneously mixing features and coordinates of multiple independent points. The extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the arbitrary-scale SR models trained on the COZ dataset compared to models trained on simulated data. Our LMI model exhibits the superior effectiveness compared to other models. This study is of great significance in developing more efficient algorithms and improving the performance of arbitrary-scale image SR methods in practical applications. Our dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/pf0607/COZ.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Fu_Continuous_Optical_Zooming_A_Benchmark_for_Arbitrary-Scale_Image_Super-Resolution_in_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Sharingan: A Transformer Architecture for Multi-Person Gaze Following,"Tafasca, Samy, Gupta, Anshul, Odobez, Jean-Marc",Gaze is a powerful form of non-verbal communication that humans develop from an early age. As such modeling this behavior is an important task that can benefit a broad set of application domains ranging from robotics to sociology. In particular the gaze following task in computer vision is defined as the prediction of the 2D pixel coordinates where a person in the image is looking. Previous attempts in this area have primarily centered on CNN-based architectures but they have been constrained by the need to process one person at a time which proves to be highly inefficient. In this paper we introduce a novel and effective multi-person transformer-based architecture for gaze prediction. While there exist prior works using transformers for multi-person gaze prediction they use a fixed set of learnable embeddings to decode both the person and its gaze target which requires a matching step afterward to link the predictions with the annotations. Thus it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate these methods reliably with the available benchmarks or integrate them into a larger human behavior understanding system. Instead we are the first to propose a multi-person transformer-based architecture that maintains the original task formulation and ensures control over the people fed as input. Our main contribution lies in encoding the person-specific information into a single controlled token to be processed alongside image tokens and using its output for prediction based on a novel multiscale decoding mechanism. Our new architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the GazeFollow VideoAttentionTarget and ChildPlay datasets and outperforms comparable multi-person architectures with a notable margin. Our code checkpoints and data extractions will be made publicly available soon.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Tafasca_Sharingan_A_Transformer_Architecture_for_Multi-Person_Gaze_Following_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Open-Vocabulary Segmentation with Semantic-Assisted Calibration,"Liu, Yong, Bai, Sule, Li, Guanbin, Wang, Yitong, Tang, Yansong",This paper studies open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) through calibrating in-vocabulary and domain-biased embedding space with generalized contextual prior of CLIP. As the core of open-vocabulary understanding alignment of visual content with the semantics of unbounded text has become the bottleneck of this field. To address this challenge recent works propose to utilize CLIP as an additional classifier and aggregate model predictions with CLIP classification results. Despite their remarkable progress performance of OVS methods in relevant scenarios is still unsatisfactory compared with supervised counterparts. We attribute this to the in-vocabulary embedding and domain-biased CLIP prediction. To this end we present a Semantic-assisted CAlibration Network (SCAN). In SCAN we incorporate generalized semantic prior of CLIP into proposal embedding to avoid collapsing on known categories. Besides a contextual shift strategy is applied to mitigate the lack of global context and unnatural background noise. With above designs SCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on all popular open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. Furthermore we also focus on the problem of existing evaluation system that ignores semantic duplication across categories and propose a new metric called Semantic-Guided IoU (SG-IoU).,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Open-Vocabulary_Segmentation_with_Semantic-Assisted_Calibration_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Towards a Perceptual Evaluation Framework for Lighting Estimation,"Giroux, Justine, Dastjerdi, Mohammad Reza Karimi, Hold-Geoffroy, Yannick, Vazquez-Corral, Javier, Lalonde, Jean-Fran√ßois",Progress in lighting estimation is tracked by computing existing image quality assessment (IQA) metrics on images from standard datasets. While this may appear to be a reasonable approach we demonstrate that doing so does not correlate to human preference when the estimated lighting is used to relight a virtual scene into a real photograph. To study this we design a controlled psychophysical experiment where human observers must choose their preference amongst rendered scenes lit using a set of lighting estimation algorithms selected from the recent literature and use it to analyse how these algorithms perform according to human perception. Then we demonstrate that none of the most popular IQA metrics from the literature taken individually correctly represent human perception. Finally we show that by learning a combination of existing IQA metrics we can more accurately represent human preference. This provides a new perceptual framework to help evaluate future lighting estimation algorithms.

On Exact Inversion of DPM-Solvers,"Hong, Seongmin, Lee, Kyeonghyun, Jeon, Suh Yoon, Bae, Hyewon, Chun, Se Young",Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are a key component in modern generative models. DPM-solvers have achieved reduced latency and enhanced quality significantly but have posed challenges to find the exact inverse (i.e. finding the initial noise from the given image). Here we investigate the exact inversions for DPM-solvers and propose algorithms to perform them when samples are generated by the first-order as well as higher-order DPM-solvers. For each explicit denoising step in DPM-solvers we formulated the inversions using implicit methods such as gradient descent or forward step method to ensure the robustness to large classifier-free guidance unlike the prior approach using fixed-point iteration. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed exact inversion methods significantly reduced the error of both image and noise reconstructions greatly enhanced the ability to distinguish invisible watermarks and well prevented unintended background changes consistently during image editing.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hong_On_Exact_Inversion_of_DPM-Solvers_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CAMEL: CAusal Motion Enhancement Tailored for Lifting Text-driven Video Editing,"Zhang, Guiwei, Zhang, Tianyu, Niu, Guanglin, Tan, Zichang, Bai, Yalong, Yang, Qing",Text-driven video editing poses significant challenges in exhibiting flicker-free visual continuity while preserving the inherent motion patterns of original videos. Existing methods operate under a paradigm where motion and appearance are intricately intertwined. This coupling leads to the network either over-fitting appearance content -- failing to capture motion patterns -- or focusing on motion patterns at the expense of content generalization to diverse textual scenarios. Inspired by the pivotal role of wavelet transform in dissecting video sequences we propose CAusal Motion Enhancement tailored for Lifting text-driven video editing (CAMEL) a novel technique with two core designs. First we introduce motion prompts designed to summarize motion concepts from video templates through direct optimization. The optimized prompts are purposefully integrated into latent representations of diffusion models to enhance the motion fidelity of generated results. Second to enhance motion coherence and extend the generalization of appearance content to creative textual prompts we propose the causal motion-enhanced attention mechanism. This mechanism is implemented in tandem with a novel causal motion filter synergistically enhancing the motion coherence of disentangled high-frequency components and concurrently preserving the generalization of appearance content across various textual scenarios. Extensive experimental results show the superior performance of CAMEL.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_CAMEL_CAusal_Motion_Enhancement_Tailored_for_Lifting_Text-driven_Video_Editing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FocSAM: Delving Deeply into Focused Objects in Segmenting Anything,"Huang, You, Lan, Zongyu, Cao, Liujuan, Lin, Xianming, Zhang, Shengchuan, Jiang, Guannan, Ji, Rongrong",The Segment Anything Model (SAM) marks a notable milestone in segmentation models highlighted by its robust zero-shot capabilities and ability to handle diverse prompts. SAM follows a pipeline that separates interactive segmentation into image preprocessing through a large encoder and interactive inference via a lightweight decoder ensuring efficient real-time performance. However SAM faces stability issues in challenging samples upon this pipeline. These issues arise from two main factors. Firstly the image preprocessing disables SAM to dynamically use image-level zoom-in strategies to refocus on the target object during interaction. Secondly the lightweight decoder struggles to sufficiently integrate interactive information with image embeddings. To address these two limitations we propose FocSAM with a pipeline redesigned on two pivotal aspects. First we propose Dynamic Window Multi-head Self-Attention (Dwin-MSA) to dynamically refocus SAM's image embeddings on the target object. Dwin-MSA localizes attention computations around the target object enhancing object-related embeddings with minimal computational overhead. Second we propose Pixel-wise Dynamic ReLU (P-DyReLU) to enable sufficient integration of interactive information from a few initial clicks that have significant impacts on the overall segmentation results. Experimentally FocSAM augments SAM's interactive segmentation performance to match the existing state-of-the-art method in segmentation quality requiring only about 5.6% of this method's inference time on CPUs.

PRDP: Proximal Reward Difference Prediction for Large-Scale Reward Finetuning of Diffusion Models,"Deng, Fei, Wang, Qifei, Wei, Wei, Hou, Tingbo, Grundmann, Matthias",Reward finetuning has emerged as a promising approach to aligning foundation models with downstream objectives. Remarkable success has been achieved in the language domain by using reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize rewards that reflect human preference. However in the vision domain existing RL-based reward finetuning methods are limited by their instability in large-scale training rendering them incapable of generalizing to complex unseen prompts. In this paper we propose Proximal Reward Difference Prediction (PRDP) enabling stable black-box reward finetuning for diffusion models for the first time on large-scale prompt datasets with over 100K prompts. Our key innovation is the Reward Difference Prediction (RDP) objective that has the same optimal solution as the RL objective while enjoying better training stability. Specifically the RDP objective is a supervised regression objective that tasks the diffusion model with predicting the reward difference of generated image pairs from their denoising trajectories. We theoretically prove that the diffusion model that obtains perfect reward difference prediction is exactly the maximizer of the RL objective. We further develop an online algorithm with proximal updates to stably optimize the RDP objective. In experiments we demonstrate that PRDP can match the reward maximization ability of well-established RL-based methods in small-scale training. Furthermore through large-scale training on text prompts from the Human Preference Dataset v2 and the Pick-a-Pic v1 dataset PRDP achieves superior generation quality on a diverse set of complex unseen prompts whereas RL-based methods completely fail.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Deng_PRDP_Proximal_Reward_Difference_Prediction_for_Large-Scale_Reward_Finetuning_of_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Task-Customized Mixture of Adapters for General Image Fusion,"Zhu, Pengfei, Sun, Yang, Cao, Bing, Hu, Qinghua",General image fusion aims at integrating important information from multi-source images. However due to the significant cross-task gap the respective fusion mechanism varies considerably in practice resulting in limited performance across subtasks. To handle this problem we propose a novel task-customized mixture of adapters (TC-MoA) for general image fusion adaptively prompting various fusion tasks in a unified model. We borrow the insight from the mixture of experts (MoE) taking the experts as efficient tuning adapters to prompt a pre-trained foundation model. These adapters are shared across different tasks and constrained by mutual information regularization ensuring compatibility with different tasks while complementarity for multi-source images. The task-specific routing networks customize these adapters to extract task-specific information from different sources with dynamic dominant intensity performing adaptive visual feature prompt fusion. Notably our TC-MoA controls the dominant intensity bias for different fusion tasks successfully unifying multiple fusion tasks in a single model. Extensive experiments show that TC-MoA outperforms the competing approaches in learning commonalities while retaining compatibility for general image fusion (multi-modal multi-exposure and multi-focus) and also demonstrating striking controllability on more generalization experiments. The code is available at https://github.com/YangSun22/TC-MoA.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_Task-Customized_Mixture_of_Adapters_for_General_Image_Fusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Artist-Friendly Relightable and Animatable Neural Heads,"Xu, Yingyan, Chandran, Prashanth, Weiss, Sebastian, Gross, Markus, Zoss, Gaspard, Bradley, Derek",An increasingly common approach for creating photo-realistic digital avatars is through the use of volumetric neural fields. The original neural radiance field (NeRF) allowed for impressive novel view synthesis of static heads when trained on a set of multi-view images and follow up methods showed that these neural representations can be extended to dynamic avatars. Recently new variants also surpassed the usual drawback of baked-in illumination in neural representations showing that static neural avatars can be relit in any environment. In this work we simultaneously tackle both the motion and illumination problem proposing a new method for relightable and animatable neural heads. Our method builds on a proven dynamic avatar approach based on a mixture of volumetric primitives combined with a recently-proposed lightweight hardware setup for relightable neural fields and includes a novel architecture that allows relighting dynamic neural avatars performing unseen expressions in any environment even with nearfield illumination and viewpoints.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_Artist-Friendly_Relightable_and_Animatable_Neural_Heads_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
From Feature to Gaze: A Generalizable Replacement of Linear Layer for Gaze Estimation,"Bao, Yiwei, Lu, Feng",Deep-learning-based gaze estimation approaches often suffer from notable performance degradation in unseen target domains. One of the primary reasons is that the Fully Connected layer is highly prone to overfitting when mapping the high-dimensional image feature to 3D gaze. In this paper we propose Analytical Gaze Generalization framework (AGG) to improve the generalization ability of gaze estimation models without touching target domain data. The AGG consists of two modules the Geodesic Projection Module (GPM) and the Sphere-Oriented Training (SOT). GPM is a generalizable replacement of FC layer which projects high-dimensional image features to 3D space analytically to extract the principle components of gaze. Then we propose Sphere-Oriented Training (SOT) to incorporate the GPM into the training process and further improve cross-domain performances. Experimental results demonstrate that the AGG effectively alleviate the overfitting problem and consistently improves the cross-domain gaze estimation accuracy in 12 cross-domain settings without requiring any target domain data. The insight from the Analytical Gaze Generalization framework has the potential to benefit other regression tasks with physical meanings.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bao_From_Feature_to_Gaze_A_Generalizable_Replacement_of_Linear_Layer_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Boosting Image Restoration via Priors from Pre-trained Models,"Xu, Xiaogang, Kong, Shu, Hu, Tao, Liu, Zhe, Bao, Hujun",Pre-trained models with large-scale training data such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion have demonstrated remarkable performance in various high-level computer vision tasks such as image understanding and generation from language descriptions. Yet their potential for low-level tasks such as image restoration remains relatively unexplored. In this paper we explore such models to enhance image restoration. As off-the-shelf features (OSF) from pre-trained models do not directly serve image restoration we propose to learn an additional lightweight module called Pre-Train-Guided Refinement Module (PTG-RM) to refine restoration results of a target restoration network with OSF. PTG-RM consists of two components Pre-Train-Guided Spatial-Varying Enhancement (PTG-SVE) and Pre-Train-Guided Channel-Spatial Attention (PTG-CSA). PTG-SVE enables optimal short- and long-range neural operations while PTG-CSA enhances spatial-channel attention for restoration-related learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PTG-RM with its compact size (<1M parameters) effectively enhances restoration performance of various models across different tasks including low-light enhancement deraining deblurring and denoising.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_Boosting_Image_Restoration_via_Priors_from_Pre-trained_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
VRetouchEr: Learning Cross-frame Feature Interdependence with Imperfection Flow for Face Retouching in Videos,"Xue, Wen, Jiang, Le, Xie, Lianxin, Wu, Si, Xu, Yong, Wong, Hau San",Face Video Retouching is a complex task that often requires labor-intensive manual editing. Conventional image retouching methods perform less satisfactorily in terms of generalization performance and stability when applied to videos without exploiting the correlation among frames. To address this issue we propose a Video Retouching transformEr to remove facial imperfections in videos which is referred to as VRetouchEr. Specifically we estimate the apparent motion of imperfections between two consecutive frames and the resulting displacement vectors are used to refine the imperfection map which is synthesized from the current frame together with the corresponding encoder features. The flow-based imperfection refinement is critical for precise and stable retouching across frames. To leverage the temporal contextual information we inject the refined imperfection map into each transformer block for multi-frame masked attention computation such that we can capture the interdependence between the current frame and multiple reference frames. As a result the imperfection regions can be replaced with normal skin with high fidelity while at the same time keeping the other regions unchanged. Extensive experiments are performed to verify the superiority of VRetouchEr over state-of-the-art image retouching methods in terms of fidelity and stability.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xue_VRetouchEr_Learning_Cross-frame_Feature_Interdependence_with_Imperfection_Flow_for_Face_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Arbitrary-Scale Image Generation and Upsampling using Latent Diffusion Model and Implicit Neural Decoder,"Kim, Jinseok, Kim, Tae-Kyun",Super-resolution (SR) and image generation are important tasks in computer vision and are widely adopted in real-world applications. Most existing methods however generate images only at fixed-scale magnification and suffer from over-smoothing and artifacts. Additionally they do not offer enough diversity of output images nor image consistency at different scales. Most relevant work applied Implicit Neural Representation (INR) to the denoising diffusion model to obtain continuous-resolution yet diverse and high-quality SR results. Since this model operates in the image space the larger the resolution of image is produced the more memory and inference time is required and it also does not maintain scale-specific consistency. We propose a novel pipeline that can super-resolve an input image or generate from a random noise a novel image at arbitrary scales. The method consists of a pretrained auto-encoder a latent diffusion model and an implicit neural decoder and their learning strategies. The proposed method adopts diffusion processes in a latent space thus efficient yet aligned with output image space decoded by MLPs at arbitrary scales. More specifically our arbitrary-scale decoder is designed by the symmetric decoder w/o up-scaling from the pretrained auto-encoder and Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF) in series. The latent diffusion process is learnt by the denoising and the alignment losses jointly. Errors in output images are backpropagated via the fixed decoder improving the quality of output images. In the extensive experiments using multiple public benchmarks on the two tasks i.e. image super-resolution and novel image generation at arbitrary scales the proposed method outperforms relevant methods in metrics of image quality diversity and scale consistency. It is significantly better than the relevant prior-art in the inference speed and memory usage.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kim_Arbitrary-Scale_Image_Generation_and_Upsampling_using_Latent_Diffusion_Model_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Cache Me if You Can: Accelerating Diffusion Models through Block Caching,"Wimbauer, Felix, Wu, Bichen, Schoenfeld, Edgar, Dai, Xiaoliang, Hou, Ji, He, Zijian, Sanakoyeu, Artsiom, Zhang, Peizhao, Tsai, Sam, Kohler, Jonas, Rupprecht, Christian, Cremers, Daniel, Vajda, Peter, Wang, Jialiang",Diffusion models have recently revolutionized the field of image synthesis due to their ability to generate photorealistic images. However one of the major drawbacks of diffusion models is that the image generation process is costly. A large image-to-image network has to be applied many times to iteratively refine an image from random noise. While many recent works propose techniques to reduce the number of required steps they generally treat the underlying denoising network as a black box. In this work we investigate the behavior of the layers within the network and find that 1) the layers' output changes smoothly over time 2) the layers show distinct patterns of change and 3) the change from step to step is often very small. We hypothesize that many layer computations in the denoising network are redundant. Leveraging this we introduce Block Caching in which we reuse outputs from layer blocks of previous steps to speed up inference. Furthermore we propose a technique to automatically determine caching schedules based on each block's changes over timesteps. In our experiments we show through FID human evaluation and qualitative analysis that Block Caching allows to generate images with higher visual quality at the same computational cost. We demonstrate this for different state-of-the-art models (LDM and EMU) and solvers (DDIM and DPM).,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wimbauer_Cache_Me_if_You_Can_Accelerating_Diffusion_Models_through_Block_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Identifying Important Group of Pixels using Interactions,"Sumiyasu, Kosuke, Kawamoto, Kazuhiko, Kera, Hiroshi",To better understand the behavior of image classifiers it is useful to visualize the contribution of individual pixels to the model prediction. In this study we propose a method MoXI(Model eXplanation by Interactions) that efficiently and accurately identifies a group of pixels with high prediction confidence. The proposed method employs game-theoretic concepts Shapley values and interactions taking into account the effects of individual pixels and the cooperative influence of pixels on model confidence. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that our method better identifies the pixels that are highly contributing to the model outputs than widely-used by Grad-CAM Attention rollout and Shapley value. While prior studies have suffered from the exponential computational cost in the computation of Shapley value and interactions we show that this can be reduced to quadratic cost for our task. The code is available at https://github.com/KosukeSumiyasu/MoXI.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sumiyasu_Identifying_Important_Group_of_Pixels_using_Interactions_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DIOD: Self-Distillation Meets Object Discovery,"Kara, Sandra, Ammar, Hejer, Denize, Julien, Chabot, Florian, Pham, Quoc-Cuong",Instance segmentation demands substantial labeling resources. This has prompted increased interest to explore the object discovery task as an unsupervised alternative. In particular promising results were achieved in localizing instances using motion supervision only. However the motion signal introduces complexities due to its inherent noise and sparsity which constrains the effectiveness of current methodologies. In the present paper we propose DIOD (self DIstillation meets Object Discovery) the first method that places the motion-guided object discovery within a framework of continuous improvement through knowledge distillation providing solutions to existing limitations (i) DIOD robustly eliminates the noise present in the exploited motion maps providing accurate motion-supervision (ii) DIOD leverages the discovered objects within an iterative pseudo-labeling framework enriching the initial motion-supervision with static objects which results in a cost-efficient increase in performance. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets we demonstrate the benefits of bridging the gap between object discovery and distillation by significantly improving the state-of-the-art. This enhancement is also sustained across other demanding metrics so far reserved for supervised tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kara_DIOD_Self-Distillation_Meets_Object_Discovery_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
GoMAvatar: Efficient Animatable Human Modeling from Monocular Video Using Gaussians-on-Mesh,"Wen, Jing, Zhao, Xiaoming, Ren, Zhongzheng, Schwing, Alexander G., Wang, Shenlong",We introduce GoMAvatar a novel approach for real-time memory-efficient high-quality animatable human modeling. GoMAvatar takes as input a single monocular video to create a digital avatar capable of re-articulation in new poses and real-time rendering from novel viewpoints while seamlessly integrating with rasterization-based graphics pipelines. Central to our method is the Gaussians-on-Mesh (GoM) representation a hybrid 3D model combining rendering quality and speed of Gaussian splatting with geometry modeling and compatibility of deformable meshes. We assess GoMAvatar on ZJU-MoCap PeopleSnapshot and various YouTube videos. GoMAvatar matches or surpasses current monocular human modeling algorithms in rendering quality and significantly outperforms them in computational efficiency (43 FPS) while being memory-efficient (3.63 MB per subject).,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wen_GoMAvatar_Efficient_Animatable_Human_Modeling_from_Monocular_Video_Using_Gaussians-on-Mesh_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Neural Redshift: Random Networks are not Random Functions,"Teney, Damien, Nicolicioiu, Armand Mihai, Hartmann, Valentin, Abbasnejad, Ehsan",Our understanding of the generalization capabilities of neural networks NNs is still incomplete. Prevailing explanations are based on implicit biases of gradient descent GD but they cannot account for the capabilities of models from gradientfree methods nor the simplicity bias recently observed in untrained networks This paper seeks other sources of generalization in NNs. To understand the inductive biases provided by architectures independently from GD we examine untrained randomweight networks Even simple MLPs show strong inductive biases uniform sampling in weight space yields a very biased distribution of functions in terms of complexity But unlike common wisdom NNs do not have an inherent simplicity bias This property depends on components such as ReLUs residual connections and layer normalizations Alternative architectures can be built with a bias for any level of complexity. Transformers also inherit all these properties from their building blocks. We provide a fresh explanation for the success of deep learning independent from gradientbased training It points at promising avenues for controlling the solutions implemented by trained models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Teney_Neural_Redshift_Random_Networks_are_not_Random_Functions_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HumanGaussian: Text-Driven 3D Human Generation with Gaussian Splatting,"Liu, Xian, Zhan, Xiaohang, Tang, Jiaxiang, Shan, Ying, Zeng, Gang, Lin, Dahua, Liu, Xihui, Liu, Ziwei",Realistic 3D human generation from text prompts is a desirable yet challenging task. Existing methods optimize 3D representations like mesh or neural fields via score distillation sampling (SDS) which suffers from inadequate fine details or excessive training time. In this paper we propose an efficient yet effective framework HumanGaussian that generates high-quality 3D humans with fine-grained geometry and realistic appearance. Our key insight is that 3D Gaussian Splatting is an efficient renderer with periodic Gaussian shrinkage or growing where such adaptive density control can be naturally guided by intrinsic human structures. Specifically 1) we first propose a Structure-Aware SDS that simultaneously optimizes human appearance and geometry. The multi-modal score function from both RGB and depth space is leveraged to distill the Gaussian densification and pruning process. 2) Moreover we devise an Annealed Negative Prompt Guidance by decomposing SDS into a noisier generative score and a cleaner classifier score which well addresses the over-saturation issue. The floating artifacts are further eliminated based on Gaussian size in a prune-only phase to enhance generation smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and competitive quality of our framework rendering vivid 3D humans under diverse scenarios.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_HumanGaussian_Text-Driven_3D_Human_Generation_with_Gaussian_Splatting_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CosmicMan: A Text-to-Image Foundation Model for Humans,"Li, Shikai, Fu, Jianglin, Liu, Kaiyuan, Wang, Wentao, Lin, Kwan-Yee, Wu, Wayne",We present CosmicMan a text-to-image foundation model specialized for generating high-fidelity human images. Unlike current general-purpose foundation models that are stuck in the dilemma of inferior quality and text-image misalignment for humans CosmicMan enables generating photo-realistic human images with meticulous appearance reasonable structure and precise text-image alignment with detailed dense descriptions. At the heart of CosmicMan's success are the new reflections and perspectives on data and models: (1) We found that data quality and a scalable data production flow are essential for the final results from trained models. Hence we propose a new data production paradigm Annotate Anyone which serves as a perpetual data flywheel to produce high-quality data with accurate yet cost-effective annotations over time. Based on this we constructed a large-scale dataset CosmicMan-HQ 1.0 with 6 Million high-quality real-world human images in a mean resolution of 1488x1255 and attached with precise text annotations deriving from 115 Million attributes in diverse granularities. (2) We argue that a text-to-image foundation model specialized for humans must be pragmatic - easy to integrate into down-streaming tasks while effective in producing high-quality human images. Hence we propose to model the relationship between dense text descriptions and image pixels in a decomposed manner and present Decomposed-Attention-Refocusing (Daring) training framework. It seamlessly decomposes the cross-attention features in existing text-to-image diffusion model and enforces attention refocusing without adding extra modules. Through Daring we show that explicitly discretizing continuous text space into several basic groups that align with human body structure is the key to tackling the misalignment problem in a breeze.

JDEC: JPEG Decoding via Enhanced Continuous Cosine Coefficients,"Han, Woo Kyoung, Im, Sunghoon, Kim, Jaedeok, Jin, Kyong Hwan",We propose a practical approach to JPEG image decoding utilizing a local implicit neural representation with continuous cosine formulation. The JPEG algorithm significantly quantizes discrete cosine transform (DCT) spectra to achieve a high compression rate inevitably resulting in quality degradation while encoding an image. We have designed a continuous cosine spectrum estimator to address the quality degradation issue that restores the distorted spectrum. By leveraging local DCT formulations our network has the privilege to exploit dequantization and upsampling simultaneously. Our proposed model enables decoding compressed images directly across different quality factors using a single pre-trained model without relying on a conventional JPEG decoder. As a result our proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance in flexible color image JPEG artifact removal tasks.

HOI-M^3: Capture Multiple Humans and Objects Interaction within Contextual Environment,"Zhang, Juze, Zhang, Jingyan, Song, Zining, Shi, Zhanhe, Zhao, Chengfeng, Shi, Ye, Yu, Jingyi, Xu, Lan, Wang, Jingya",Humans naturally interact with both others and the surrounding multiple objects engaging in various social activities. However recent advances in modeling human-object interactions mostly focus on perceiving isolated individuals and objects due to fundamental data scarcity. In this paper we introduce HOI-M^3 a novel large-scale dataset for modeling the interactions of Multiple huMans and Multiple objects. Notably it provides accurate 3D tracking for both humans and objects from dense RGB and object-mounted IMU inputs covering 199 sequences and 181M frames of diverse humans and objects under rich activities. With the unique HOI-M^3 dataset we introduce two novel data-driven tasks with companion strong baselines: monocular capture and unstructured generation of multiple human-object interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our dataset is challenging and worthy of further research about multiple human-object interactions and behavior analysis. Our HOI-M^3 dataset corresponding codes and pre-trained models will be disseminated to the community for future research.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_HOI-M3_Capture_Multiple_Humans_and_Objects_Interaction_within_Contextual_Environment_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Interactive3D: Create What You Want by Interactive 3D Generation,"Dong, Shaocong, Ding, Lihe, Huang, Zhanpeng, Wang, Zibin, Xue, Tianfan, Xu, Dan",3D object generation has undergone significant advancements yielding high-quality results. However fall short in achieving precise user control often yielding results that do not align with user expectations thus limiting their applicability. User-envisioning 3D object generation faces significant challenges in realizing its concepts using current generative models due to limited interaction capabilities. Existing methods mainly offer two approaches: (i) interpreting textual instructions with constrained controllability or (ii) reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images. Both of them limit customization to the confines of the 2D reference and potentially introduce undesirable artifacts during the 3D lifting process restricting the scope for direct and versatile 3D modifications. In this work we introduce Interactive3D an innovative framework for interactive 3D generation that grants users precise control over the generative process through extensive 3D interaction capabilities. Interactive3D is constructed in two cascading stages utilizing distinct 3D representations. The first stage employs Gaussian Splatting for direct user interaction allowing modifications and guidance of the generative direction at any intermediate step through (i) Adding and Removing components (ii) Deformable and Rigid Dragging (iii) Geometric Transformations and (iv) Semantic Editing. Subsequently the Gaussian splats are transformed into InstantNGP. We introduce a novel (v) Interactive Hash Refinement module to further add details and extract the geometry in the second stage. Our experiments demonstrate that proposed Interactive3D markedly improves the controllability and quality of 3D generation.

OmniLocalRF: Omnidirectional Local Radiance Fields from Dynamic Videos,"Choi, Dongyoung, Jang, Hyeonjoong, Kim, Min H.",Omnidirectional cameras are extensively used in various applications to provide a wide field of vision. However they face a challenge in synthesizing novel views due to the inevitable presence of dynamic objects including the photographer in their wide field of view. In this paper we introduce a new approach called Omnidirectional Local Radiance Fields (OmniLocalRF) that can render static-only scene views removing and inpainting dynamic objects simultaneously. Our approach combines the principles of local radiance fields with the bidirectional optimization of omnidirectional rays. Our input is an omnidirectional video and we evaluate the mutual observations of the entire angle between the previous and current frames. To reduce ghosting artifacts of dynamic objects and inpaint occlusions we devise a multi-resolution motion mask prediction module. Unlike existing methods that primarily separate dynamic components through the temporal domain our method uses multi-resolution neural feature planes for precise segmentation which is more suitable for long 360-degree videos. Our experiments validate that OmniLocalRF outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics especially in scenarios with complex real-world scenes. In particular our approach eliminates the need for manual interaction such as drawing motion masks by hand and additional pose estimation making it a highly effective and efficient solution.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Choi_OmniLocalRF_Omnidirectional_Local_Radiance_Fields_from_Dynamic_Videos_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Semantic Human Mesh Reconstruction with Textures,"Zhan, Xiaoyu, Yang, Jianxin, Li, Yuanqi, Guo, Jie, Guo, Yanwen, Wang, Wenping",The field of 3D detailed human mesh reconstruction has made significant progress in recent years. However current methods still face challenges when used in industrial applications due to unstable results low-quality meshes and a lack of UV unwrapping and skinning weights. In this paper we present SHERT a novel pipeline that can reconstruct semantic human meshes with textures and high-precision details. SHERT applies semantic- and normal-based sampling between the detailed surface (e.g. mesh and SDF) and the corresponding SMPL-X model to obtain a partially sampled semantic mesh and then generates the complete semantic mesh by our specifically designed self-supervised completion and refinement networks. Using the complete semantic mesh as a basis we employ a texture diffusion model to create human textures that are driven by both images and texts. Our reconstructed meshes have stable UV unwrapping high-quality triangle meshes and consistent semantic information. The given SMPL-X model provides semantic information and shape priors allowing SHERT to perform well even with incorrect and incomplete inputs. The semantic information also makes it easy to substitute and animate different body parts such as the face body and hands. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SHERT is capable of producing high-fidelity and robust semantic meshes that outperform state-of-the-art methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhan_Semantic_Human_Mesh_Reconstruction_with_Textures_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PIA: Your Personalized Image Animator via Plug-and-Play Modules in Text-to-Image Models,"Zhang, Yiming, Xing, Zhening, Zeng, Yanhong, Fang, Youqing, Chen, Kai",Recent advancements in personalized text-to-image (T2I) models have revolutionized content creation empowering non-experts to generate stunning images with unique styles. While promising animating these personalized images with realistic motions poses significant challenges in preserving distinct styles high-fidelity details and achieving motion controllability by text. In this paper we present PIA a Personalized Image Animator that excels in aligning with condition images achieving motion controllability by text and the compatibility with various personalized T2I models without specific tuning. To achieve these goals PIA builds upon a base T2I model with well-trained temporal alignment layers allowing for the seamless transformation of any personalized T2I model into an image animation model. A key component of PIA is the introduction of the condition module which takes as inputs the condition frame and inter-frame affinity. This module leverages the affinity hint to transfer appearance information from the condition frame to individual frames in the latent space. This design mitigates the challenges of appearance-related frame alignment within PIA and allows for a stronger focus on aligning with motion-related guidance. To address the lack of a benchmark for this field we introduce AnimateBench a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse personalized T2I models curated images and motion-related prompts. We show extensive evaluations and applications on AnimateBench to verify the superiority of PIA.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_PIA_Your_Personalized_Image_Animator_via_Plug-and-Play_Modules_in_Text-to-Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
NeRF Analogies: Example-Based Visual Attribute Transfer for NeRFs,"Fischer, Michael, Li, Zhengqin, Nguyen-Phuoc, Thu, Bozic, Aljaz, Dong, Zhao, Marshall, Carl, Ritschel, Tobias",A Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) encodes the specific relation of 3D geometry and appearance of a scene. We here ask the question whether we can transfer the appearance from a source NeRF onto a target 3D geometry in a semantically meaningful way such that the resulting new NeRF retains the target geometry but has an appearance that is an analogy to the source NeRF. To this end we generalize classic image analogies from 2D images to NeRFs. We leverage correspondence transfer along semantic affinity that is driven by semantic features from large pre-trained 2D image models to achieve multi-view consistent appearance transfer. Our method allows exploring the mix-and-match product space of 3D geometry and appearance. We show that our method outperforms traditional stylization-based methods and that a large majority of users prefer our method over several typical baselines.

Texture-Preserving Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity Virtual Try-On,"Yang, Xu, Ding, Changxing, Hong, Zhibin, Huang, Junhao, Tao, Jin, Xu, Xiangmin",Image-based virtual try-on is an increasingly important task for online shopping. It aims to synthesize images of a specific person wearing a specified garment. Diffusion model-based approaches have recently become popular as they are excellent at image synthesis tasks. However these approaches usually employ additional image encoders and rely on the cross-attention mechanism for texture transfer from the garment to the person image which affects the try-on's efficiency and fidelity. To address these issues we propose an Texture-Preserving Diffusion (TPD) model for virtual try-on which enhances the fidelity of the results and introduces no additional image encoders. Accordingly we make contributions from two aspects. First we propose to concatenate the masked person and reference garment images along the spatial dimension and utilize the resulting image as the input for the diffusion model's denoising UNet. This enables the original self-attention layers contained in the diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate texture transfer. Second we propose a novel diffusion-based method that predicts a precise inpainting mask based on the person and reference garment images further enhancing the reliability of the try-on results. In addition we integrate mask prediction and image synthesis into a single compact model. The experimental results show that our approach can be applied to various try-on tasks e.g. garment-to-person and person-to-person try-ons and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular VITON VITON-HD databases.

Towards Robust Event-guided Low-Light Image Enhancement: A Large-Scale Real-World Event-Image Dataset and Novel Approach,"Liang, Guoqiang, Chen, Kanghao, Li, Hangyu, Lu, Yunfan, Wang, Lin",Event camera has recently received much attention for low-light image enhancement (LIE) thanks to their distinct advantages such as high dynamic range. However current research is prohibitively restricted by the lack of large-scale real-world and spatial-temporally aligned event-image datasets. To this end we propose a real-world (indoor and outdoor) dataset comprising over 30K pairs of images and events under both low and normal illumination conditions. To achieve this we utilize a robotic arm that traces a consistent non-linear trajectory to curate the dataset with spatial alignment precision under 0.03mm. We then introduce a matching alignment strategy rendering 90% of our dataset with errors less than 0.01s. Based on the dataset we propose a novel event-guided LIE approach called EvLight towards robust performance in real-world low-light scenes. Specifically we first design the multi-scale holistic fusion branch to extract holistic structural and textural information from both events and images. To ensure robustness against variations in the regional illumination and noise we then introduce a Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR)-guided regional feature selection to selectively fuse features of images from regions with high SNR and enhance those with low SNR by extracting regional structural information from events. our EvLight significantly surpasses the frame-based methods e.g. Retinexformer by 1.14 dB and 2.62 dB respectively. Code and datasets are available at https://vlislab22.github.io/eg-lowlight/.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liang_Towards_Robust_Event-guided_Low-Light_Image_Enhancement_A_Large-Scale_Real-World_Event-Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
From a Bird's Eye View to See: Joint Camera and Subject Registration without the Camera Calibration,"Qian, Zekun, Han, Ruize, Feng, Wei, Wang, Song",We tackle a new problem of multi-view camera and subject registration in the bird's eye view (BEV) without pre-given camera calibration which promotes the multi-view subject registration problem to a new calibration-free stage. This greatly alleviates the limitation in many practical applications. However this is a very challenging problem since its only input is several RGB images from different first-person views (FPVs) without the BEV image and the calibration of the FPVs while the output is a unified plane aggregated from all views with the positions and orientations of both the subjects and cameras in a BEV. For this purpose we propose an end-to-end framework solving camera and subject registration together by taking advantage of their mutual dependence whose main idea is as below: i) creating a subject view-transform module (VTM) to project each pedestrian from FPV to a virtual BEV ii) deriving a multi-view geometry-based spatial alignment module (SAM) to estimate the relative camera pose in a unified BEV iii) selecting and refining the subject and camera registration results within the unified BEV. We collect a new large-scale synthetic dataset with rich annotations for training and evaluation. Additionally we also collect a real dataset for cross-domain evaluation. The experimental results show the remarkable effectiveness of our method. The code and proposed datasets are available at https://github.com/zekunqian/BEVSee.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Qian_From_a_Birds_Eye_View_to_See_Joint_Camera_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Enhancing Video Super-Resolution via Implicit Resampling-based Alignment,"Xu, Kai, Yu, Ziwei, Wang, Xin, Mi, Michael Bi, Yao, Angela",In video super-resolution it is common to use a frame-wise alignment to support the propagation of information over time. The role of alignment is well-studied for low-level enhancement in video but existing works overlook a critical step -- resampling. We show through extensive experiments that for alignment to be effective the resampling should preserve the reference frequency spectrum while minimizing spatial distortions. However most existing works simply use a default choice of bilinear interpolation for resampling even though bilinear interpolation has a smoothing effect and hinders super-resolution. From these observations we propose an implicit resampling-based alignment. The sampling positions are encoded by a sinusoidal positional encoding while the value is estimated with a coordinate network and a window-based cross-attention. We show that bilinear interpolation inherently attenuates high-frequency information while an MLP-based coordinate network can approximate more frequencies. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that alignment with our proposed implicit resampling enhances the performance of state-of-the-art frameworks with minimal impact on both compute and parameters.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_Enhancing_Video_Super-Resolution_via_Implicit_Resampling-based_Alignment_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning via Cross Block Orchestration for Segment Anything Model,"Peng, Zelin, Xu, Zhengqin, Zeng, Zhilin, Xie, Lingxi, Tian, Qi, Shen, Wei",Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is an effective methodology to unleash the potential of large foundation models in novel scenarios with limited training data. In the computer vision community PEFT has shown effectiveness in image classification but little research has studied its ability for image segmentation. Fine-tuning segmentation models usually require a heavier adjustment of parameters to align the proper projection directions in the parameter space for new scenarios. This raises a challenge to existing PEFT algorithms as they often inject a limited number of individual parameters into each block which prevents substantial adjustment of the projection direction of the parameter space due to the limitation of Hidden Markov Chain along blocks. In this paper we equip PEFT with a cross-block orchestration mechanism to enable the adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to various downstream scenarios. We introduce a novel inter-block communication module which integrates a learnable relation matrix to facilitate communication among different coefficient sets of each PEFT block's parameter space. Moreover we propose an intra-block enhancement module which introduces a linear projection head whose weights are generated from a hyper-complex layer further enhancing the impact of the adjustment of projection directions on the entire parameter space. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently improves the segmentation performance significantly on novel scenarios with only around 1K additional parameters.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Peng_Parameter_Efficient_Fine-tuning_via_Cross_Block_Orchestration_for_Segment_Anything_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Masked and Shuffled Blind Spot Denoising for Real-World Images,"Chihaoui, Hamadi, Favaro, Paolo",We introduce a novel approach to single image denoising based on the Blind Spot Denoising principle which we call MAsked and SHuffled Blind Spot Denoising (MASH). We focus on the case of correlated noise which often plagues real images. MASH is the result of a careful analysis to determine the relationships between the level of blindness (masking) of the input and the (unknown) noise correlation. Moreover we introduce a shuffling technique to weaken the local correlation of noise which in turn yields an additional denoising performance improvement. We evaluate MASH via extensive experiments on real-world noisy image datasets. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results compared to existing self-supervised denoising methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chihaoui_Masked_and_Shuffled_Blind_Spot_Denoising_for_Real-World_Images_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DiffusionAvatars: Deferred Diffusion for High-fidelity 3D Head Avatars,"Kirschstein, Tobias, Giebenhain, Simon, Nie√üner, Matthias",DiffusionAvatars synthesizes a high-fidelity 3D head avatar of a person offering intuitive control over both pose and expression. We propose a diffusion-based neural renderer that leverages generic 2D priors to produce compelling images of faces. For coarse guidance of the expression and head pose we render a neural parametric head model (NPHM) from the target viewpoint which acts as a proxy geometry of the person. Additionally to enhance the modeling of intricate facial expressions we condition DiffusionAvatars directly on the expression codes obtained from NPHM via cross-attention. Finally to synthesize consistent surface details across different viewpoints and expressions we rig learnable spatial features to the head's surface via TriPlane lookup in NPHM's canonical space. We train DiffusionAvatars on RGB videos and corresponding fitted NPHM meshes of a person and test the obtained avatars in both self-reenactment and animation scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that DiffusionAvatars generates temporally consistent and visually appealing videos for novel poses and expressions of a person outperforming existing approaches.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kirschstein_DiffusionAvatars_Deferred_Diffusion_for_High-fidelity_3D_Head_Avatars_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Data-Free Quantization via Pseudo-label Filtering,"Fan, Chunxiao, Wang, Ziqi, Guo, Dan, Wang, Meng",Quantization for model compression can efficiently reduce the network complexity and storage requirement but the original training data is necessary to remedy the performance loss caused by quantization. The Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) methods have been proposed to handle the absence of original training data with synthetic data. However there are differences between the synthetic and original training data which affects the performance of the quantized network but none of the existing methods considers the differences. In this paper we propose an efficient data-free quantization via pseudo-label filtering which is the first to evaluate the synthetic data before quantization. We design a new metric for evaluating synthetic data using self-entropy which indicates the reliability of synthetic data. The synthetic data can be categorized with the metric into high- and low-reliable datasets for the following training process. Besides the multiple pseudo-labels are designed to label the synthetic data with different reliability which can provide valuable supervision information and avoid misleading training by low-reliable samples. Extensive experiments are implemented on several datasets including CIFAR-10 CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with various models. The experimental results show that our method can perform excellently and outperform existing methods in accuracy.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Fan_Data-Free_Quantization_via_Pseudo-label_Filtering_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Generative Powers of Ten,"Wang, Xiaojuan, Kontkanen, Janne, Curless, Brian, Seitz, Steven M., Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, Ira, Mildenhall, Ben, Srinivasan, Pratul, Verbin, Dor, Holynski, Aleksander",We present a method that uses a text-to-image model to generate consistent content across multiple image scales enabling extreme semantic zooms into a scene e.g. ranging from a wide-angle landscape view of a forest to a macro shot of an insect sitting on one of the tree branches. We achieve this through a joint multi-scale diffusion sampling approach that encourages consistency across different scales while preserving the integrity of each individual sampling process. Since each generated scale is guided by a different text prompt our method enables deeper levels of zoom than traditional super-resolution methods that may struggle to create new contextual structure at vastly different scales. We compare our method qualitatively with alternative techniques in image super-resolution and outpainting and show that our method is most effective at generating consistent multi-scale content.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Generative_Powers_of_Ten_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Text-conditional Attribute Alignment across Latent Spaces for 3D Controllable Face Image Synthesis,"Xu, Feifan, Li, Rui, Wu, Si, Xu, Yong, Wong, Hau San",With the advent of generative models and vision language pretraining significant improvement has been made in text-driven face manipulation. The text embedding can be used as target supervision for expression control.However it is non-trivial to associate with its 3D attributesi.e. pose and illumination. To address these issues we propose a Text-conditional Attribute aLignment approach for 3D controllable face image synthesis and our model is referred to as TcALign. Specifically since the 3D rendered image can be precisely controlled with the 3D face representation we first propose a Text-conditional 3D Editor to produce the target face representation to realize text-driven manipulation in the 3D space. An attribute embedding space spanned by the target-related attributes embeddings is also introduced to infer the disentangled task-specific direction. Next we train a cross-modal latent mapping network conditioned on the derived difference of 3D representation to infer a correct vector in the latent space of StyleGAN.Thiscorrection vector learning design can accurately transfer the attribute manipulation on 3D images to 2D images. We show that the proposed method delivers more precise text-driven multi-attribute manipulation for 3D controllable face image synthesis. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify the effectiveness and superiority of our method over the other competing methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_Text-conditional_Attribute_Alignment_across_Latent_Spaces_for_3D_Controllable_Face_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Correcting Diffusion Generation through Resampling,"Liu, Yujian, Zhang, Yang, Jaakkola, Tommi, Chang, Shiyu",Despite diffusion models' superior capabilities in modeling complex distributions there are still non-trivial distributional discrepancies between generated and ground-truth images which has resulted in several notable problems in image generation including missing object errors in text-to-image generation and low image quality. Existing methods that attempt to address these problems mostly do not tend to address the fundamental cause behind these problems which is the distributional discrepancies and hence achieve sub-optimal results. In this paper we propose a particle filtering framework that can effectively address both problems by explicitly reducing the distributional discrepancies. Specifically our method relies on a set of external guidance including a small set of real images and a pre-trained object detector to gauge the distribution gap and then design the resampling weight accordingly to correct the gap. Experiments show that our methods can effectively correct missing object errors and improve image quality in various image generation tasks. Notably our method outperforms the existing strongest baseline by 5% in object occurrence and 1.0 in FID on MS-COCO. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/diffusion_resampling.git.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Correcting_Diffusion_Generation_through_Resampling_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AirPlanes: Accurate Plane Estimation via 3D-Consistent Embeddings,"Watson, Jamie, Aleotti, Filippo, Sayed, Mohamed, Qureshi, Zawar, Mac Aodha, Oisin, Brostow, Gabriel, Firman, Michael, Vicente, Sara",Extracting planes from a 3D scene is useful for downstream tasks in robotics and augmented reality. In this paper we tackle the problem of estimating the planar surfaces in a scene from posed images. Our first finding is that a surprisingly competitive baseline results from combining popular clustering algorithms with recent improvements in 3D geometry estimation. However such purely geometric methods are understandably oblivious to plane semantics which are crucial to discerning distinct planes. To overcome this limitation we propose a method that predicts multi-view consistent plane embeddings that complement geometry when clustering points into planes. We show through extensive evaluation on the ScanNetV2 dataset that our new method outperforms existing approaches and our strong geometric baseline for the task of plane estimation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Watson_AirPlanes_Accurate_Plane_Estimation_via_3D-Consistent_Embeddings_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Blur2Blur: Blur Conversion for Unsupervised Image Deblurring on Unknown Domains,"Pham, Bang-Dang, Tran, Phong, Tran, Anh, Pham, Cuong, Nguyen, Rang, Hoai, Minh",This paper presents an innovative framework designed to train an image deblurring algorithm tailored to a specific camera device. This algorithm works by transforming a blurry input image which is challenging to deblur into another blurry image that is more amenable to deblurring. The transformation process from one blurry state to another leverages unpaired data consisting of sharp and blurry images captured by the target camera device. Learning this blur-to-blur transformation is inherently simpler than direct blur-to-sharp conversion as it primarily involves modifying blur patterns rather than the intricate task of reconstructing fine image details. The efficacy of the proposed approach has been demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/Blur2Blur,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Pham_Blur2Blur_Blur_Conversion_for_Unsupervised_Image_Deblurring_on_Unknown_Domains_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Exploring Vision Transformers for 3D Human Motion-Language Models with Motion Patches,"Yu, Qing, Tanaka, Mikihiro, Fujiwara, Kent","To build a cross-modal latent space between 3D human motion and language acquiring large-scale and high-quality human motion data is crucial. However unlike the abundance of image data the scarcity of motion data has limited the performance of existing motion-language models. To counter this we introduce ""motion patches"" a new representation of motion sequences and propose using Vision Transformers (ViT) as motion encoders via transfer learning aiming to extract useful knowledge from the image domain and apply it to the motion domain. These motion patches created by dividing and sorting skeleton joints based on body parts in motion sequences are robust to varying skeleton structures and can be regarded as color image patches in ViT. We find that transfer learning with pre-trained weights of ViT obtained through training with 2D image data can boost the performance of motion analysis presenting a promising direction for addressing the issue of limited motion data. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed motion patches used jointly with ViT achieve state-of-the-art performance in the benchmarks of text-to-motion retrieval and other novel challenging tasks such as cross-skeleton recognition zero-shot motion classification and human interaction recognition which are currently impeded by the lack of data.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yu_Exploring_Vision_Transformers_for_3D_Human_Motion-Language_Models_with_Motion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Clustering for Protein Representation Learning,"Quan, Ruijie, Wang, Wenguan, Ma, Fan, Fan, Hehe, Yang, Yi",Protein representation learning is a challenging task that aims to capture the structure and function of proteins from their amino acid sequences. Previous methods largely ignored the fact that not all amino acids are equally important for protein folding and activity. In this article we propose a neural clustering framework that can automatically discover the critical components of a protein by considering both its primary and tertiary structure information. Our framework treats a protein as a graph where each node represents an amino acid and each edge represents a spatial or sequential connection between amino acids. We then apply an iterative clustering strategy to group the nodes into clusters based on their 1D and 3D positions and assign scores to each cluster. We select the highest-scoring clusters and use their medoid nodes for the next iteration of clustering until we obtain a hierarchical and informative representation of the protein. We evaluate on four protein-related tasks: protein fold classification enzyme reaction classification gene ontology term prediction and enzyme commission number prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Quan_Clustering_for_Protein_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CorrMatch: Label Propagation via Correlation Matching for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Sun, Boyuan, Yang, Yuqi, Zhang, Le, Cheng, Ming-Ming, Hou, Qibin",This paper presents a simple but performant semi-supervised semantic segmentation approach called CorrMatch. Previous approaches mostly employ complicated training strategies to leverage unlabeled data but overlook the role of correlation maps in modeling the relationships between pairs of locations. We observe that the correlation maps not only enable clustering pixels of the same category easily but also contain good shape information which previous works have omitted. Motivated by these we aim to improve the use efficiency of unlabeled data by designing two novel label propagation strategies. First we propose to conduct pixel propagation by modeling the pairwise similarities of pixels to spread the high-confidence pixels and dig out more. Then we perform region propagation to enhance the pseudo labels with accurate class-agnostic masks extracted from the correlation maps. CorrMatch achieves great performance on popular segmentation benchmarks. Taking the DeepLabV3+ with ResNet-101 backbone as our segmentation model we receive a 76%+ mIoU score on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset with only 92 annotated images.

Estimating Extreme 3D Image Rotations using Cascaded Attention,"Dekel, Shay, Keller, Yosi, Cadik, Martin",Estimating large extreme inter-image rotations is critical for numerous computer vision domains involving images related by limited or non-overlapping fields of view. In this work we propose an attention-based approach with a pipeline of novel algorithmic components. First as rotation estimation pertains to image pairs we introduce an inter-image distillation scheme using Decoders to improve embeddings. Second whereas contemporary methods compute a 4D correlation volume (4DCV) encoding inter-image relationships we propose an Encoder-based cross-attention approach between activation maps to compute an enhanced equivalent of the 4DCV. Finally we present a cascaded Decoder-based technique for alternately refining the cross-attention and the rotation query. Our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on extreme rotation estimation. We make our code publicly available.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Dekel_Estimating_Extreme_3D_Image_Rotations_using_Cascaded_Attention_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Adapt or Perish: Adaptive Sparse Transformer with Attentive Feature Refinement for Image Restoration,"Zhou, Shihao, Chen, Duosheng, Pan, Jinshan, Shi, Jinglei, Yang, Jufeng",Transformer-based approaches have achieved promising performance in image restoration tasks given their ability to model long-range dependencies which is crucial for recovering clear images. Though diverse efficient attention mechanism designs have addressed the intensive computations associated with using transformers they often involve redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions by considering all available tokens. In this work we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST) to mitigate the noisy interactions of irrelevant areas and remove feature redundancy in both spatial and channel domains. AST comprises two core designs i.e. an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). Specifically ASSA is adaptively computed using a two-branch paradigm where the sparse branch is introduced to filter out the negative impacts of low query-key matching scores for aggregating features while the dense one ensures sufficient information flow through the network for learning discriminative representations. Meanwhile FRFN employs an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy in channels enhancing the restoration of clear latent images. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks have demonstrated the versatility and competitive performance of our method in several tasks including rain streak removal real haze removal and raindrop removal. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/joshyZhou/AST.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_Adapt_or_Perish_Adaptive_Sparse_Transformer_with_Attentive_Feature_Refinement_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
VINECS: Video-based Neural Character Skinning,"Liao, Zhouyingcheng, Golyanik, Vladislav, Habermann, Marc, Theobalt, Christian",Rigging and skinning clothed human avatars is a challenging task and traditionally requires a lot of manual work and expertise. Recent methods addressing it either generalize across different characters or focus on capturing the dynamics of a single character observed under different pose configurations. However the former methods typically predict solely static skinning weights which perform poorly for highly articulated poses and the latter ones either require dense 3D character scans in different poses or cannot generate an explicit mesh with vertex correspondence over time. To address these challenges we propose a fully automated approach for creating a fully rigged character with pose-dependent skinning weights which can be solely learned from multi-view video. Therefore we first acquire a rigged template which is then statically skinned. Next a coordinate-based MLP learns a skinning weights field parameterized over the position in a canonical pose space and the respective pose. Moreover we introduce our pose- and view-dependent appearance field allowing us to differentiably render and supervise the posed mesh using multi-view imagery. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art while not relying on dense 4D scans. More details can be found on our project page.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liao_VINECS_Video-based_Neural_Character_Skinning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Your Student is Better Than Expected: Adaptive Teacher-Student Collaboration for Text-Conditional Diffusion Models,"Starodubcev, Nikita, Baranchuk, Dmitry, Fedorov, Artem, Babenko, Artem",Knowledge distillation methods have recently shown to be a promising direction to speedup the synthesis of large-scale diffusion models by requiring only a few inference steps. While several powerful distillation methods were recently proposed the overall quality of student samples is typically lower compared to the teacher ones which hinders their practical usage. In this work we investigate the relative quality of samples produced by the teacher text-to-image diffusion model and its distilled student version. As our main empirical finding we discover that a noticeable portion of student samples exhibit superior fidelity compared to the teacher ones despite the approximate nature of the student. Based on this finding we propose an adaptive collaboration between student and teacher diffusion models for effective text-to-image synthesis. Specifically the distilled model produces an initial image sample and then an oracle decides whether it needs further improvements with the teacher model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the designed pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art text-to-image alternatives for various inference budgets in terms of human preference. Furthermore the proposed approach can be naturally used in popular applications such as text-guided image editing and controllable generation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Starodubcev_Your_Student_is_Better_Than_Expected_Adaptive_Teacher-Student_Collaboration_for_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SHViT: Single-Head Vision Transformer with Memory Efficient Macro Design,"Yun, Seokju, Ro, Youngmin",Recently efficient Vision Transformers have shown great performance with low latency on resource-constrained devices. Conventionally they use 4x4 patch embeddings and a 4-stage structure at the macro level while utilizing sophisticated attention with multi-head configuration at the micro level. This paper aims to address computational redundancy at all design levels in a memory-efficient manner. We discover that using larger-stride patchify stem not only reduces memory access costs but also achieves competitive performance by leveraging token representations with reduced spatial redundancy from the early stages. Furthermore our preliminary analyses suggest that attention layers in the early stages can be substituted with convolutions and several attention heads in the latter stages are computationally redundant. To handle this we introduce a single-head attention module that inherently prevents head redundancy and simultaneously boosts accuracy by parallelly combining global and local information. Building upon our solutions we introduce SHViT a Single-Head Vision Transformer that obtains the state-of-the-art speed-accuracy tradeoff. For example on ImageNet-1k our SHViT-S4 is 3.3x 8.1x and 2.4x faster than MobileViTv2x1.0 on GPU CPU and iPhone12 mobile device respectively while being 1.3% more accurate. For object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO using Mask-RCNN head our model achieves performance comparable to FastViT-SA12 while exhibiting 3.8x and 2.0x lower backbone latency on GPU and mobile device respectively.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yun_SHViT_Single-Head_Vision_Transformer_with_Memory_Efficient_Macro_Design_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CommonCanvas: Open Diffusion Models Trained on Creative-Commons Images,"Gokaslan, Aaron, Cooper, A. Feder, Collins, Jasmine, Seguin, Landan, Jacobson, Austin, Patel, Mihir, Frankle, Jonathan, Stephenson, Cory, Kuleshov, Volodymyr",We train a set of open text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models on a dataset of curated Creative-Commons-licensed (CC) images which yields models that are competitive with Stable Diffusion 2 (SD2). This task presents two challenges: (1) high-resolution CC images lack the captions necessary to train T2I models; (2) CC images are relatively scarce. To address these challenges we use an intuitive transfer learning technique to produce a set of high-quality synthetic captions paired with our assembled CC images. We then develop a data- and compute-efficient training recipe that requires as little as 3% of the LAION data (i.e. roughly 70 million examples) needed to train existing SD2 models but obtains the same quality. These results indicate that we have a sufficient number of CC images (also roughly 70 million) for training high-quality models. Our recipe also implements a variety of optimizations that achieve 2.71x training speed-ups enabling rapid model iteration. We leverage this recipe to train several high-quality T2I mod- els which we dub the CommonCanvas family. Our largest model achieves comparable performance to SD2 on human evaluation even though we use a synthetically captioned CC-image dataset that is only <3% the size of LAION for training. We release our models data and code on GitHub.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Gokaslan_CommonCanvas_Open_Diffusion_Models_Trained_on_Creative-Commons_Images_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Prompt-Driven Referring Image Segmentation with Instance Contrasting,"Shang, Chao, Song, Zichen, Qiu, Heqian, Wang, Lanxiao, Meng, Fanman, Li, Hongliang",Referring image segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target referent described by natural language. Recently large-scale pre-trained models e.g. CLIP and SAM have been successfully applied in many downstream tasks but they are not well adapted to RIS task due to inter-task differences. In this paper we propose a new prompt-driven framework named Prompt-RIS which bridges CLIP and SAM end-to-end and transfers their rich knowledge and powerful capabilities to RIS task through prompt learning. To adapt CLIP to pixel-level task we first propose a Cross-Modal Prompting method which acquires more comprehensive vision-language interaction and fine-grained text-to-pixel alignment by performing bidirectional prompting. Then the prompt-tuned CLIP generates masks points and text prompts for SAM to generate more accurate mask predictions. Moreover we further propose Instance Contrastive Learning to improve the model's discriminability to different instances and robustness to diverse languages describing the same instance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods consistently in both general and open-vocabulary settings.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shang_Prompt-Driven_Referring_Image_Segmentation_with_Instance_Contrasting_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Image Sculpting: Precise Object Editing with 3D Geometry Control,"Yenphraphai, Jiraphon, Pan, Xichen, Liu, Sainan, Panozzo, Daniele, Xie, Saining",We present Image Sculpting a new framework for editing 2D images by incorporating tools from 3D geometry and graphics. This approach differs markedly from existing methods which are confined to 2D spaces and typically rely on textual instructions leading to ambiguity and limited control. Image Sculpting converts 2D objects into 3D enabling direct interaction with their 3D geometry. Post-editing these objects are re-rendered into 2D merging into the original image to produce high-fidelity results through a coarse-to-fine enhancement process. The framework supports precise quantifiable and physically-plausible editing options such as pose editing rotation translation 3D composition carving and serial addition. It marks an initial step towards combining the creative freedom of generative models with the precision of graphics pipelines.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yenphraphai_Image_Sculpting_Precise_Object_Editing_with_3D_Geometry_Control_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PFStorer: Personalized Face Restoration and Super-Resolution,"Varanka, Tuomas, Toivonen, Tapani, Tripathy, Soumya, Zhao, Guoying, Acar, Erman",Recent developments in face restoration have achieved remarkable results in producing high-quality and lifelike outputs. The stunning results however often fail to be faithful with respect to the identity of the person as the models lack necessary context. In this paper we explore the potential of personalized face restoration with diffusion models. In our approach a restoration model is personalized using a few images of the identity leading to tailored restoration with respect to the identity while retaining fine-grained details. By using independent trainable blocks for personalization the rich prior of a base restoration model can be exploited to its fullest. To avoid the model relying on parts of identity left in the conditioning low-quality images a generative regularizer is employed. With a learnable parameter the model learns to balance between the details generated based on the input image and the degree of personalization. Moreover we improve the training pipeline of face restoration models to enable an alignment-free approach. We showcase the robust capabilities of our approach in several real-world scenarios with multiple identities demonstrating our method's ability to generate fine-grained details with faithful restoration. In the user study we evaluate the perceptual quality and faithfulness of the generated details with our method being voted best 61% of the time compared to the second best with 25% of the votes.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Varanka_PFStorer_Personalized_Face_Restoration_and_Super-Resolution_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
TextureDreamer: Image-Guided Texture Synthesis Through Geometry-Aware Diffusion,"Yeh, Yu-Ying, Huang, Jia-Bin, Kim, Changil, Xiao, Lei, Nguyen-Phuoc, Thu, Khan, Numair, Zhang, Cheng, Chandraker, Manmohan, Marshall, Carl S, Dong, Zhao, Li, Zhengqin",We present TextureDreamer a novel image-guided texture synthesis method to transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images (3 to 5) to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. Texture creation is a pivotal challenge in vision and graphics. Industrial companies hire experienced artists to manually craft textures for 3D assets. Classical methods require densely sampled views and accurately aligned geometry while learning-based methods are confined to category-specific shapes within the dataset. In contrast TextureDreamer can transfer highly detailed intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects with only a few casually captured images potentially significantly democratizing texture creation. Our core idea personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD) draws inspiration from recent advancements in diffuse models including personalized modeling for texture information extraction score distillation for detailed appearance synthesis and explicit geometry guidance with ControlNet. Our integration and several essential modifications substantially improve the texture quality. Experiments on real images spanning different categories show that TextureDreamer can successfully transfer highly realistic semantic meaningful texture to arbitrary objects surpassing the visual quality of previous state-of-the-art.

Boosting Image Quality Assessment through Efficient Transformer Adaptation with Local Feature Enhancement,"Xu, Kangmin, Liao, Liang, Xiao, Jing, Chen, Chaofeng, Wu, Haoning, Yan, Qiong, Lin, Weisi",Image Quality Assessment (IQA) constitutes a fundamental task within the field of computer vision yet it remains an unresolved challenge owing to the intricate distortion conditions diverse image contents and limited availability of data. Recently the community has witnessed the emergence of numerous large-scale pretrained foundation models. However it remains an open problem whether the scaling law in high-level tasks is also applicable to IQA tasks which are closely related to low-level clues. In this paper we demonstrate that with a proper injection of local distortion features a larger pretrained vision transformer (ViT) foundation model performs better in IQA tasks. Specifically for the lack of local distortion structure and inductive bias of the large-scale pretrained ViT we use another pretrained convolution neural networks (CNNs) which is well known for capturing the local structure to extract multi-scale image features. Further we propose a local distortion extractor to obtain local distortion features from the pretrained CNNs and a local distortion injector to inject the local distortion features into ViT. By only training the extractor and injector our method can benefit from the rich knowledge in the powerful foundation models and achieve state-of-the-art performance on popular IQA datasets indicating that IQA is not only a low-level problem but also benefits from stronger high-level features drawn from large-scale pretrained models. Codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/NeosXu/LoDa.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_Boosting_Image_Quality_Assessment_through_Efficient_Transformer_Adaptation_with_Local_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Attention Calibration for Disentangled Text-to-Image Personalization,"Zhang, Yanbing, Yang, Mengping, Zhou, Qin, Wang, Zhe",Recent thrilling progress in large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models has unlocked unprecedented synthesis quality of AI-generated content (AIGC) including image generation 3D and video composition. Further personalized techniques enable appealing customized production of a novel concept given only several images as reference. However an intriguing problem persists: Is it possible to capture multiple novel concepts from one single reference image? In this paper we identify that existing approaches fail to preserve visual consistency with the reference image and eliminate cross-influence from concepts. To alleviate this we propose an attention calibration mechanism to improve the concept-level understanding of the T2I model. Specifically we first introduce new learnable modifiers bound with classes to capture attributes of multiple concepts. Then the classes are separated and strengthened following the activation of the cross-attention operation ensuring comprehensive and self-contained concepts. Additionally we suppress the attention activation of different classes to mitigate mutual influence among concepts. Together our proposed method dubbed DisenDiff can learn disentangled multiple concepts from one single image and produce novel customized images with learned concepts. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state of the art in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. More importantly our proposed techniques are compatible with LoRA and inpainting pipelines enabling more interactive experiences.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Attention_Calibration_for_Disentangled_Text-to-Image_Personalization_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
One-Shot Structure-Aware Stylized Image Synthesis,"Cho, Hansam, Lee, Jonghyun, Chang, Seunggyu, Jeong, Yonghyun",While GAN-based models have been successful in image stylization tasks they often struggle with structure preservation while stylizing a wide range of input images. Recently diffusion models have been adopted for image stylization but still lack the capability to maintain the original quality of input images. Building on this we propose OSASIS: a novel one-shot stylization method that is robust in structure preservation. We show that OSASIS is able to effectively disentangle the semantics from the structure of an image allowing it to control the level of content and style implemented to a given input. We apply OSASIS to various experimental settings including stylization with out-of-domain reference images and stylization with text-driven manipulation. Results show that OSASIS outperforms other stylization methods especially for input images that were rarely encountered during training providing a promising solution to stylization via diffusion models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cho_One-Shot_Structure-Aware_Stylized_Image_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MR-VNet: Media Restoration using Volterra Networks,"Roheda, Siddharth, Unde, Amit, Rashid, Loay",This research paper presents a novel class of restoration network architecture based on the Volterra series formulation. By incorporating non-linearity into the system response function through higher order convolutions instead of traditional activation functions we introduce a general framework for image/video restoration. Through extensive experimentation we demonstrate that our proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the field of Image/Video Restoration. Moreover we establish that the recently introduced Non-Linear Activation Free Network (NAF-NET) can be considered a special case within the broader class of Volterra Neural Networks. These findings highlight the potential of Volterra Neural Networks as a versatile and powerful tool for addressing complex restoration tasks in computer vision.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Roheda_MR-VNet_Media_Restoration_using_Volterra_Networks_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Single Mesh Diffusion Models with Field Latents for Texture Generation,"Mitchel, Thomas W., Esteves, Carlos, Makadia, Ameesh",We introduce a framework for intrinsic latent diffusion models operating directly on the surfaces of 3D shapes with the goal of synthesizing high-quality textures. Our approach is underpinned by two contributions: Field Latents a latent representation encoding textures as discrete vector fields on the mesh vertices and Field Latent Diffusion Models which learn to denoise a diffusion process in the learned latent space on the surface. We consider a single-textured-mesh paradigm where our models are trained to generate variations of a given texture on a mesh. We show the synthesized textures are of superior fidelity compared those from existing single-textured-mesh generative models. Our models can also be adapted for user-controlled editing tasks such as inpainting and label-guided generation. The efficacy of our approach is due in part to the equivariance of our proposed framework under isometries allowing our models to seamlessly reproduce details across locally similar regions and opening the door to a notion of generative texture transfer. Code and visualizations are available at https://single-mesh-diffusion.github.io/.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mitchel_Single_Mesh_Diffusion_Models_with_Field_Latents_for_Texture_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SAI3D: Segment Any Instance in 3D Scenes,"Yin, Yingda, Liu, Yuzheng, Xiao, Yang, Cohen-Or, Daniel, Huang, Jingwei, Chen, Baoquan",Advancements in 3D instance segmentation have traditionally been tethered to the availability of annotated datasets limiting their application to a narrow spectrum of object categories. Recent efforts have sought to harness vision-language models like CLIP for open-set semantic reasoning yet these methods struggle to distinguish between objects of the same categories and rely on specific prompts that are not universally applicable. In this paper we introduce SAI3D a novel zero-shot 3D instance segmentation approach that synergistically leverages geometric priors and semantic cues derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our method partitions a 3D scene into geometric primitives which are then progressively merged into 3D instance segmentations that are consistent with the multi-view SAM masks. Moreover we design a hierarchical region-growing algorithm with a dynamic thresholding mechanism which largely improves the robustness of fine-grained 3D scene parsing. Empirical evaluations on ScanNet Matterport3D and the more challenging ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably SAI3D outperforms existing open-vocabulary baselines and even surpasses fully-supervised methods in class-agnostic segmentation on ScanNet++.

TexOct: Generating Textures of 3D Models with Octree-based Diffusion,"Liu, Jialun, Wu, Chenming, Liu, Xinqi, Liu, Xing, Wu, Jinbo, Peng, Haotian, Zhao, Chen, Feng, Haocheng, Liu, Jingtuo, Ding, Errui",This paper focuses on synthesizing high-quality and complete textures directly on the surface of 3D models within 3D space. 2D diffusion-based methods face challenges in generating 2D texture maps due to the infinite possibilities of UV mapping for a given 3D mesh. Utilizing point clouds helps circumvent variations arising from diverse mesh topologies and UV mappings. Nevertheless achieving dense point clouds to accurately represent texture details poses a challenge due to limited computational resources. To address these challenges we propose an efficient octree-based diffusion pipeline called TexOct. Our method starts by sampling a point cloud from the surface of a given 3D model with each point containing texture noise values. We utilize an octree structure to efficiently represent this point cloud. Additionally we introduce an innovative octree-based diffusion model that leverages the denoising capabilities of the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). This model gradually reduces the texture noise on the octree nodes resulting in the restoration of fine texture. Experimental results on ShapeNet demonstrate that TexOct effectively generates high-quality 3D textures in both unconditional and text / image-conditional scenarios.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_TexOct_Generating_Textures_of_3D_Models_with_Octree-based_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Anatomically Constrained Implicit Face Models,"Chandran, Prashanth, Zoss, Gaspard",Coordinate based implicit neural representations have gained rapid popularity in recent years as they have been successfully used in image geometry and scene modeling tasks. In this work we present a novel use case for such implicit representations in the context of learning anatomically constrained face models. Actor specific anatomically constrained face models are the state of the art in both facial performance capture and performance retargeting. Despite their practical success these anatomical models are slow to evaluate and often require extensive data capture to be built. We propose the anatomical implicit face model; an ensemble of implicit neural networks that jointly learn to model the facial anatomy and the skin surface with high-fidelity and can readily be used as a drop in replacement to conventional blendshape models. Given an arbitrary set of skin surface meshes of an actor and only a neutral shape with estimated skull and jaw bones our method can recover a dense anatomical substructure which constrains every point on the facial surface. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in several tasks ranging from shape fitting shape editing and performance retargeting.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chandran_Anatomically_Constrained_Implicit_Face_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Capturing Closely Interacted Two-Person Motions with Reaction Priors,"Fang, Qi, Fan, Yinghui, Li, Yanjun, Dong, Junting, Wu, Dingwei, Zhang, Weidong, Chen, Kang",In this paper we focus on capturing closely interacted two-person motions from monocular videos an important yet understudied topic. Unlike less-interacted motions closely interacted motions contain frequently occurring inter-human occlusions which pose significant challenges to existing capturing algorithms. To address this problem our key observation is that close physical interactions between two subjects typically happen under very specific situations (e.g. handshake hug etc.) and such situational contexts contain strong prior semantics to help infer the poses of occluded joints. In this spirit we introduce reaction priors which are invertible neural networks that bi-directionally model the pose probability distributions of one person given the pose of the other. The learned reaction priors are then incorporated into a query-based pose estimator which is a decoder-only Transformer with self-attentions on both intra-joint and inter-joint relationships. We demonstrate that our design achieves considerably higher performance than previous methods on multiple benchmarks. What's more as existing datasets lack sufficient cases of close human-human interactions we also build a new dataset called Dual-Human to better evaluate different methods. Dual-Human contains around 2k sequences of closely interacted two-person motions each with synthetic multi-view renderings contact annotations and text descriptions. We believe that this new public dataset can significantly promote further research in this area.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Fang_Capturing_Closely_Interacted_Two-Person_Motions_with_Reaction_Priors_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
RobustSAM: Segment Anything Robustly on Degraded Images,"Chen, Wei-Ting, Vong, Yu-Jiet, Kuo, Sy-Yen, Ma, Sizhou, Wang, Jian",Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a transformative approach in image segmentation acclaimed for its robust zero-shot segmentation capabilities and flexible prompting system. Nonetheless its performance is challenged by images with degraded quality. Addressing this limitation we propose the Robust Segment Anything Model (RobustSAM) which enhances SAM's performance on low-quality images while preserving its promptability and zero-shot generalization. Our method leverages the pre-trained SAM model with only marginal parameter increments and computational requirements. The additional parameters of RobustSAM can be optimized within 30 hours on eight GPUs demonstrating its feasibility and practicality for typical research laboratories. We also introduce the Robust-Seg dataset a collection of 688K image-mask pairs with different degradations designed to train and evaluate our model optimally. Extensive experiments across various segmentation tasks and datasets confirm RobustSAM's superior performance especially under zero-shot conditions underscoring its potential for extensive real-world application. Additionally our method has been shown to effectively improve the performance of SAM-based downstream tasks such as single image dehazing and deblurring.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_RobustSAM_Segment_Anything_Robustly_on_Degraded_Images_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
In-N-Out: Faithful 3D GAN Inversion with Volumetric Decomposition for Face Editing,"Xu, Yiran, Shu, Zhixin, Smith, Cameron, Oh, Seoung Wug, Huang, Jia-Bin",3D-aware GANs offer new capabilities for view synthesis while preserving the editing functionalities of their 2D counterparts. GAN inversion is a crucial step that seeks the latent code to reconstruct input images or videos subsequently enabling diverse editing tasks through manipulation of this latent code. However a model pre-trained on a particular dataset (e.g. FFHQ) often has difficulty reconstructing images with out-of-distribution (OOD) objects such as faces with heavy make-up or occluding objects. We address this issue by explicitly modeling OOD objects from the input in 3D-aware GANs. Our core idea is to represent the image using two individual neural radiance fields: one for the in-distribution content and the other for the out-of-distribution object. The final reconstruction is achieved by optimizing the composition of these two radiance fields with carefully designed regularization. We demonstrate that our explicit decomposition alleviates the inherent trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and editability. We evaluate reconstruction accuracy and editability of our method on challenging real face images and videos and showcase favorable results against other baselines.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_In-N-Out_Faithful_3D_GAN_Inversion_with_Volumetric_Decomposition_for_Face_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Combining Frame and GOP Embeddings for Neural Video Representation,"Saethre, Jens Eirik, Azevedo, Roberto, Schroers, Christopher",Implicit neural representations (INRs) were recently proposed as a new video compression paradigm with existing approaches performing on par with HEVC. However such methods only perform well in limited settings e.g. specific model sizes fixed aspect ratios and low-motion videos. We address this issue by proposing T-NeRV a hybrid video INR that combines frame-specific embeddings with GOP-specific features providing a lever for content-specific fine-tuning. We employ entropy-constrained training to jointly optimize our model for rate and distortion and demonstrate that T-NeRV can thereby automatically adjust this lever during training effectively fine-tuning itself to the target content. We evaluate T-NeRV on the UVG dataset where it achieves state-of-the-art results on the video representation task outperforming previous works by up to 3dB PSNR on challenging high-motion sequences. Further our method improves on the compression performance of previous methods and is the first video INR to outperform HEVC on all UVG sequences.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Saethre_Combining_Frame_and_GOP_Embeddings_for_Neural_Video_Representation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Fantastic Animals and Where to Find Them: Segment Any Marine Animal with Dual SAM,"Zhang, Pingping, Yan, Tianyu, Liu, Yang, Lu, Huchuan",As an important pillar of underwater intelligence Marine Animal Segmentation (MAS) involves segmenting animals within marine environments. Previous methods don't excel in extracting long-range contextual features and overlook the connectivity between discrete pixels. Recently Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers a universal framework for general segmentation tasks. Unfortunately trained with natural images SAM does not obtain the prior knowledge from marine images. In addition the single-position prompt of SAM is very insufficient for prior guidance. To address these issues we propose a novel feature learning framework named Dual-SAM for high-performance MAS. To this end we first introduce a dual structure with SAM's paradigm to enhance feature learning of marine images. Then we propose a Multi-level Coupled Prompt (MCP) strategy to instruct comprehensive underwater prior information and enhance the multi-level features of SAM's encoder with adapters. Subsequently we design a Dilated Fusion Attention Module (DFAM) to progressively integrate multi-level features from SAM's encoder. Finally instead of directly predicting the masks of marine animals we propose a Criss-Cross Connectivity Prediction (C3P) paradigm to capture the inter-connectivity between discrete pixels. With dual decoders it generates pseudo-labels and achieves mutual supervision for complementary feature representations resulting in considerable improvements over previous techniques. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on five widely-used MAS datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Drchip61/Dual SAM.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Fantastic_Animals_and_Where_to_Find_Them_Segment_Any_Marine_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Seeing and Hearing: Open-domain Visual-Audio Generation with Diffusion Latent Aligners,"Xing, Yazhou, He, Yingqing, Tian, Zeyue, Wang, Xintao, Chen, Qifeng",Video and audio content creation serves as the core technique for the movie industry and professional users. Recently existing diffusion-based methods tackle video and audio generation separately which hinders the technique transfer from academia to industry. In this work we aim at filling the gap with a carefully designed optimization-based framework for cross-visual-audio and joint-visual-audio generation. We observe the powerful generation ability of off-the-shelf video or audio generation models. Thus instead of training the giant models from scratch we propose to bridge the existing strong models with a shared latent representation space. Specifically we propose a multimodality latent aligner with the pre-trained ImageBind model. Our latent aligner shares a similar core as the classifier guidance that guides the diffusion denoising process during inference time. Through carefully designed optimization strategy and loss functions we show the superior performance of our method on joint video-audio generation visual-steered audio generation and audio-steered visual generation tasks.

Objects as Volumes: A Stochastic Geometry View of Opaque Solids,"Miller, Bailey, Chen, Hanyu, Lai, Alice, Gkioulekas, Ioannis",We develop a theory for the representation of opaque solids as volumes. Starting from a stochastic representation of opaque solids as random indicator functions we prove the conditions under which such solids can be modeled using exponential volumetric transport. We also derive expressions for the volumetric attenuation coefficient as a functional of the probability distributions of the underlying indicator functions. We generalize our theory to account for isotropic and anisotropic scattering at different parts of the solid and for representations of opaque solids as stochastic implicit surfaces. We derive our volumetric representation from first principles which ensures that it satisfies physical constraints such as reciprocity and reversibility. We use our theory to explain compare and correct previous volumetric representations as well as propose meaningful extensions that lead to improved performance in 3D reconstruction tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Miller_Objects_as_Volumes_A_Stochastic_Geometry_View_of_Opaque_Solids_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Improving Subject-Driven Image Synthesis with Subject-Agnostic Guidance,"Chan, Kelvin C.K., Zhao, Yang, Jia, Xuhui, Yang, Ming-Hsuan, Wang, Huisheng",In subject-driven text-to-image synthesis the synthesis process tends to be heavily influenced by the reference images provided by users often overlooking crucial attributes detailed in the text prompt. In this work we propose Subject-Agnostic Guidance (SAG) a simple yet effective solution to remedy the problem. We show that through constructing a subject-agnostic condition and applying our proposed dual classifier-free guidance one could obtain outputs consistent with both the given subject and input text prompts. We validate the efficacy of our approach through both optimization-based and encoder-based methods. Additionally we demonstrate its applicability in second-order customization methods where an encoder-based model is fine-tuned with DreamBooth. Our approach is conceptually simple and requires only minimal code modifications but leads to substantial quality improvements as evidenced by our evaluations and user studies.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chan_Improving_Subject-Driven_Image_Synthesis_with_Subject-Agnostic_Guidance_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Diffusion Model Alignment Using Direct Preference Optimization,"Wallace, Bram, Dang, Meihua, Rafailov, Rafael, Zhou, Linqi, Lou, Aaron, Purushwalkam, Senthil, Ermon, Stefano, Xiong, Caiming, Joty, Shafiq, Naik, Nikhil",Large language models (LLMs) are fine-tuned using human comparison data with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods to make them better aligned with users' preferences. In contrast to LLMs human preference learning has not been widely explored in text-to-image diffusion models; the best existing approach is to fine-tune a pretrained model using carefully curated high quality images and captions to improve visual appeal and text alignment. We propose Diffusion-DPO a method to align diffusion models to human preferences by directly optimizing on human comparison data. Diffusion-DPO is adapted from the recently developed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) a simpler alternative to RLHF which directly optimizes a policy that best satisfies human preferences under a classification objective. We re-formulate DPO to account for a diffusion model notion of likelihood utilizing the evidence lower bound to derive a differentiable objective. Using the Pick-a-pic dataset of 851K crowdsourced pairwise preferences we fine-tune the base model of the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)-1.0 model with Diffusion-DPO. Our fine-tuned base model significantly outperforms both base SDXL-1.0 and the larger SDXL-1.0 model consisting of an additional refinement model in human evaluation improving visual appeal and prompt alignment. We also develop a variant that uses AI feedback and has comparable performance to training on human preferences opening the door for scaling of diffusion model alignment methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wallace_Diffusion_Model_Alignment_Using_Direct_Preference_Optimization_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ZeroNVS: Zero-Shot 360-Degree View Synthesis from a Single Image,"Sargent, Kyle, Li, Zizhang, Shah, Tanmay, Herrmann, Charles, Yu, Hong-Xing, Zhang, Yunzhi, Chan, Eric Ryan, Lagun, Dmitry, Fei-Fei, Li, Sun, Deqing, Wu, Jiajun","We introduce a 3D-aware diffusion model ZeroNVS for single-image novel view synthesis for in-the-wild scenes. While existing methods are designed for single objects with masked backgrounds we propose new techniques to address challenges introduced by in-the-wild multi-object scenes with complex backgrounds. Specifically we train a generative prior on a mixture of data sources that capture object-centric indoor and outdoor scenes. To address issues from data mixture such as depth-scale ambiguity we propose a novel camera conditioning parameterization and normalization scheme. Further we observe that Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) tends to truncate the distribution of complex backgrounds during distillation of 360-degree scenes and propose ""SDS anchoring"" to improve the diversity of synthesized novel views. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art result in LPIPS on the DTU dataset in the zero-shot setting even outperforming methods specifically trained on DTU. We further adapt the challenging Mip-NeRF 360 dataset as a new benchmark for single-image novel view synthesis and demonstrate strong performance in this setting. Code and models will be publicly available.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sargent_ZeroNVS_Zero-Shot_360-Degree_View_Synthesis_from_a_Single_Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Restoration by Generation with Constrained Priors,"Ding, Zheng, Zhang, Xuaner, Tu, Zhuowen, Xia, Zhihao",The inherent generative power of denoising diffusion models makes them well-suited for image restoration tasks where the objective is to find the optimal high-quality image within the generative space that closely resembles the input image. We propose a method to adapt a pretrained diffusion model for image restoration by simply adding noise to the input image to be restored and then denoise. Our method is based on the observation that the space of a generative model needs to be constrained. We impose this constraint by finetuning the generative model with a set of anchor images that capture the characteristics of the input image. With the constrained space we can then leverage the sampling strategy used for generation to do image restoration. We evaluate against previous methods and show superior performances on multiple real-world restoration datasets in preserving identity and image quality. We also demonstrate an important and practical application on personalized restoration where we use a personal album as the anchor images to constrain the generative space. This approach allows us to produce results that accurately preserve high-frequency details which previous works are unable to do.

Blur-aware Spatio-temporal Sparse Transformer for Video Deblurring,"Zhang, Huicong, Xie, Haozhe, Yao, Hongxun",Video deblurring relies on leveraging information from other frames in the video sequence to restore the blurred regions in the current frame. Mainstream approaches employ bidirectional feature propagation spatio-temporal transformers or a combination of both to extract information from the video sequence. However limitations in memory and computational resources constraints the temporal window length of the spatio-temporal transformer preventing the extraction of longer temporal contextual information from the video sequence. Additionally bidirectional feature propagation is highly sensitive to inaccurate optical flow in blurry frames leading to error accumulation during the propagation process. To address these issues we propose BSSTNet Blur-aware Spatio-temporal Sparse Transformer Network. It introduces the blur map which converts the originally dense attention into a sparse form enabling a more extensive utilization of information throughout the entire video sequence. Specifically BSSTNet (1) uses a longer temporal window in the transformer leveraging information from more distant frames to restore the blurry pixels in the current frame. (2) introduces bidirectional feature propagation guided by blur maps which reduces error accumulation caused by the blur frame. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed BSSTNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the GoPro and DVD datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Blur-aware_Spatio-temporal_Sparse_Transformer_for_Video_Deblurring_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DiffusionPoser: Real-time Human Motion Reconstruction From Arbitrary Sparse Sensors Using Autoregressive Diffusion,"Van Wouwe, Tom, Lee, Seunghwan, Falisse, Antoine, Delp, Scott, Liu, C. Karen",Motion capture from a limited number of body-worn sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and pressure insoles has important applications in health human performance and entertainment. Recent work has focused on accurately reconstructing whole-body motion from a specific sensor configuration using six IMUs. While a common goal across applications is to use the minimal number of sensors to achieve required accuracy the optimal arrangement of the sensors might differ from application to application. We propose a single diffusion model DiffusionPoser which reconstructs human motion in real-time from an arbitrary combination of sensors including IMUs placed at specified locations and pressure insoles. Unlike existing methods our model grants users the flexibility to determine the number and arrangement of sensors tailored to the specific activity of interest without the need for retraining. A novel autoregressive inferencing scheme ensures real-time motion reconstruction that closely aligns with measured sensor signals.

MANUS: Markerless Grasp Capture using Articulated 3D Gaussians,"Pokhariya, Chandradeep, Shah, Ishaan Nikhil, Xing, Angela, Li, Zekun, Chen, Kefan, Sharma, Avinash, Sridhar, Srinath",Understanding how we grasp objects with our hands has important applications in areas like robotics and mixed reality. However this challenging problem requires accurate modeling of the contact between hands and objects.To capture grasps existing methods use skeletons meshes or parametric models that does not represent hand shape accurately resulting in inaccurate contacts. We present MANUS a method for Markerless Hand-Object Grasp Capture using Articulated 3D Gaussians. We build a novel articulated 3D Gaussians representation that extends 3D Gaussian splatting for high-fidelity representation of articulating hands. Since our representation uses Gaussian primitives optimized from the multi-view pixel-aligned losses it enables us to efficiently and accurately estimate contacts between the hand and the object. For the most accurate results our method requires tens of camera views that current datasets do not provide. We therefore build MANUS-Grasps a new dataset that contains hand-object grasps viewed from 50+ cameras across 30+ scenes 3 subjects and comprising over 7M frames. In addition to extensive qualitative results we also show that our method outperforms others on a quantitative contact evaluation method that uses paint transfer from the object to the hand.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Pokhariya_MANUS_Markerless_Grasp_Capture_using_Articulated_3D_Gaussians_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
BerfScene: Bev-conditioned Equivariant Radiance Fields for Infinite 3D Scene Generation,"Zhang, Qihang, Xu, Yinghao, Shen, Yujun, Dai, Bo, Zhou, Bolei, Yang, Ceyuan",Generating large-scale 3D scenes cannot simply apply existing 3D object synthesis technique since 3D scenes usually hold complex spatial configurations and consist of a number of objects at varying scales. We thus propose a practical and efficient 3D representation that incorporates an equivariant radiance field with the guidance of a bird's-eye view (BEV) map. Concretely objects of synthesized 3D scenes could be easily manipulated through steering the corresponding BEV maps. Moreover by adequately incorporating positional encoding and low-pass filters into the generator the representation becomes equivariant to the given BEV map. Such equivariance allows us to produce large-scale even infinite-scale 3D scenes via synthesizing local scenes and then stitching them with smooth consistency. Extensive experiments on 3D scene datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

3D Facial Expressions through Analysis-by-Neural-Synthesis,"Retsinas, George, Filntisis, Panagiotis P., Danecek, Radek, Abrevaya, Victoria F., Roussos, Anastasios, Bolkart, Timo, Maragos, Petros",While existing methods for 3D face reconstruction from in-the-wild images excel at recovering the overall face shape they commonly miss subtle extreme asymmetric or rarely observed expressions. We improve upon these methods with SMIRK (Spatial Modeling for Image-based Reconstruction of Kinesics) which faithfully reconstructs expressive 3D faces from images. We identify two key limitations in existing methods: shortcomings in their self-supervised training formulation and a lack of expression diversity in the training images. For training most methods employ differentiable rendering to compare a predicted face mesh with the input image along with a plethora of additional loss functions. This differentiable rendering loss not only has to provide supervision to optimize for 3D face geometry camera albedo and lighting which is an ill-posed optimization problem but the domain gap between rendering and input image further hinders the learning process. Instead SMIRK replaces the differentiable rendering with a neural rendering module that given the rendered predicted mesh geometry and sparsely sampled pixels of the input image generates a face image. As the neural rendering gets color information from sampled image pixels supervising with neural rendering-based reconstruction loss can focus solely on the geometry. Further it enables us to generate images of the input identity with varying expressions while training. These are then utilized as input to the reconstruction model and used as supervision with ground truth geometry. This effectively augments the training data and enhances the generalization for diverse expressions. Our qualitative quantitative and particularly our perceptual evaluations demonstrate that SMIRK achieves the new state-of-the art performance on accurate expression reconstruction.

Unleashing the Potential of SAM for Medical Adaptation via Hierarchical Decoding,"Cheng, Zhiheng, Wei, Qingyue, Zhu, Hongru, Wang, Yan, Qu, Liangqiong, Shao, Wei, Zhou, Yuyin",The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered significant attention for its versatile segmentation abilities and intuitive prompt-based interface. However its application in medical imaging presents challenges requiring either substantial training costs and extensive medical datasets for full model fine-tuning or high-quality prompts for optimal performance. This paper introduces H-SAM: a prompt-free adaptation of SAM tailored for efficient fine-tuning of medical images via a two-stage hierarchical decoding procedure. In the initial stage H-SAM employs SAM's original decoder to generate a prior probabilistic mask guiding a more intricate decoding process in the second stage. Specifically we propose two key designs: 1) A class-balanced mask-guided self-attention mechanism addressing the unbalanced label distribution enhancing image embedding; 2) A learnable mask cross-attention mechanism spatially modulating the interplay among different image regions based on the prior mask. Moreover the inclusion of a hierarchical pixel decoder in H-SAM enhances its proficiency in capturing fine-grained and localized details. This approach enables SAM to effectively integrate learned medical priors facilitating enhanced adaptation for medical image segmentation with limited samples. Our H-SAM demonstrates a 4.78% improvement in average Dice compared to existing prompt-free SAM variants for multi-organ segmentation using only 10% of 2D slices. Notably without using any unlabeled data H-SAM even outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised models relying on extensive unlabeled training data across various medical datasets.

Puff-Net: Efficient Style Transfer with Pure Content and Style Feature Fusion Network,"Zheng, Sizhe, Gao, Pan, Zhou, Peng, Qin, Jie",Style transfer aims to render an image with the artistic features of a style image while maintaining the original structure. Various methods have been put forward for this task but some challenges still exist. For instance it is difficult for CNN-based methods to handle global information and long-range dependencies between input images for which transformer-based methods have been proposed. Although transformer can better model the relationship between content and style images they require high-cost hardware and time-consuming inference. To address these issues we design a novel transformer model that includes only encoders thus significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition we also find that existing style transfer methods may lead to images under-stylied or missing content. In order to achieve better stylization we design a content feature extractor and a style feature extractor. Then we can feed pure content and style images into the transformer. Finally we propose a network model termed Puff-Net i.e. efficient style transfer with pure content and style feature fusion network. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments we demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to state-of-the-art ones in the literature. The code is availabel at https://github.com/ZszYmy9/Puff-Net.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zheng_Puff-Net_Efficient_Style_Transfer_with_Pure_Content_and_Style_Feature_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Towards Progressive Multi-Frequency Representation for Image Warping,"Xiao, Jun, Lyu, Zihang, Zhang, Cong, Ju, Yakun, Shui, Changjian, Lam, Kin-Man",Image warping a classic task in computer vision aims to use geometric transformations to change the appearance of images. Recent methods learn the resampling kernels for warping through neural networks to estimate missing values in irregular grids which however fail to capture local variations in deformed content and produce images with distortion and less high-frequency details. To address this issue this paper proposes an effective method namely MFR to learn Multi-Frequency Representations from input images for image warping. Specifically we propose a progressive filtering network to learn image representations from different frequency subbands and generate deformable images in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore we employ learnable Gabor wavelet filters to improve the model's capability to learn local spatial-frequency representations. Comprehensive experiments including homography transformation equirectangular to perspective projection and asymmetric image super-resolution demonstrate that the proposed MFR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image warping methods. Our method also showcases superior generalization to out-of-distribution domains where the generated images are equipped with rich details and less distortion thereby high visual quality.

Learning to Control Camera Exposure via Reinforcement Learning,"Lee, Kyunghyun, Shin, Ukcheol, Lee, Byeong-Uk",Adjusting camera exposure in arbitrary lighting conditions is the first step to ensure the functionality of computer vision applications. Poorly adjusted camera exposure often leads to critical failure and performance degradation. Traditional camera exposure control methods require multiple convergence steps and time-consuming processes making them unsuitable for dynamic lighting conditions. In this paper we propose a new camera exposure control framework that rapidly controls camera exposure while performing real-time processing by exploiting deep reinforcement learning. The proposed framework consists of four contributions: 1) a simplified training ground to simulate real-world's diverse and dynamic lighting changes 2) flickering and image attribute-aware reward design along with lightweight state design for real-time processing 3) a static-to-dynamic lighting curriculum to gradually improve the agent's exposure-adjusting capability and 4) domain randomization techniques to alleviate the limitation of the training ground and achieve seamless generalization in the wild. As a result our proposed method rapidly reaches a desired exposure level within five steps with real-time processing (1 ms). Also the acquired images are well-exposed and show superiority in various computer vision tasks such as feature extraction and object detection.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_Learning_to_Control_Camera_Exposure_via_Reinforcement_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
RNb-NeuS: Reflectance and Normal-based Multi-View 3D Reconstruction,"Brument, Baptiste, Bruneau, Robin, Qu√©au, Yvain, M√©lou, Jean, Lauze, Fran√ßois Bernard, Durou, Jean-Denis, Calvet, Lilian",This paper introduces a versatile paradigm for integrating multi-view reflectance (optional) and normal maps acquired through photometric stereo. Our approach employs a pixel-wise joint re-parameterization of reflectance and normal considering them as a vector of radiances rendered under simulated varying illumination. This re-parameterization enables the seamless integration of reflectance and normal maps as input data in neural volume rendering-based 3D reconstruction while preserving a single optimization objective. In contrast recent multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) methods depend on multiple potentially conflicting objectives. Despite its apparent simplicity our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in MVPS benchmarks across F-score Chamfer distance and mean angular error metrics. Notably it significantly improves the detailed 3D reconstruction of areas with high curvature or low visibility.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Brument_RNb-NeuS_Reflectance_and_Normal-based_Multi-View_3D_Reconstruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Scaling Up Dynamic Human-Scene Interaction Modeling,"Jiang, Nan, Zhang, Zhiyuan, Li, Hongjie, Ma, Xiaoxuan, Wang, Zan, Chen, Yixin, Liu, Tengyu, Zhu, Yixin, Huang, Siyuan",Confronting the challenges of data scarcity and advanced motion synthesis in human-scene interaction modeling we introduce the TRUMANS dataset alongside a novel HSI motion synthesis method. TRUMANS stands as the most comprehensive motion-captured HSI dataset currently available encompassing over 15 hours of human interactions across 100 indoor scenes. It intricately captures whole-body human motions and part-level object dynamics focusing on the realism of contact. This dataset is further scaled up by transforming physical environments into exact virtual models and applying extensive augmentations to appearance and motion for both humans and objects while maintaining interaction fidelity. Utilizing TRUMANS we devise a diffusion-based autoregressive model that efficiently generates HSI sequences of any length taking into account both scene context and intended actions. In experiments our approach shows remarkable zero-shot generalizability on a range of 3D scene datasets (e.g. PROX Replica ScanNet ScanNet++) producing motions that closely mimic original motion-captured sequences as confirmed by quantitative experiments and human studies.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jiang_Scaling_Up_Dynamic_Human-Scene_Interaction_Modeling_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Semantic-aware SAM for Point-Prompted Instance Segmentation,"Wei, Zhaoyang, Chen, Pengfei, Yu, Xuehui, Li, Guorong, Jiao, Jianbin, Han, Zhenjun",Single-point annotation in visual tasks with the goal of minimizing labeling costs is becoming increasingly prominent in research. Recently visual foundation models such as Segment Anything (SAM) have gained widespread usage due to their robust zero-shot capabilities and exceptional annotation performance. However SAM's class-agnostic output and high confidence in local segmentation introduce semantic ambiguity posing a challenge for precise category-specific segmentation. In this paper we introduce a cost-effective category-specific segmenter using SAM. To tackle this challenge we have devised a Semantic-Aware Instance Segmentation Network (SAPNet) that integrates Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) with matching capability and SAM with point prompts. SAPNet strategically selects the most representative mask proposals generated by SAM to supervise segmentation with a specific focus on object category information. Moreover we introduce the Point Distance Guidance and Box Mining Strategy to mitigate inherent challenges: group and local issues in weakly supervised segmentation. These strategies serve to further enhance the overall segmentation performance. The experimental results on Pascal VOC and COCO demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed SAPNet emphasizing its semantic matching capabilities and its potential to advance point-prompted instance segmentation.

Make Pixels Dance: High-Dynamic Video Generation,"Zeng, Yan, Wei, Guoqiang, Zheng, Jiani, Zou, Jiaxin, Wei, Yang, Zhang, Yuchen, Li, Hang",Creating high-dynamic videos such as motion-rich actions and sophisticated visual effects poses a significant challenge in the field of artificial intelligence. Unfortunately current state-of-the-art video generation methods primarily focusing on text-to-video generation tend to produce video clips with minimal motions despite maintaining high fidelity. We argue that relying solely on text instructions is insufficient and suboptimal for video generation. In this paper we introduce PixelDance a novel approach based on diffusion models that incorporates image instructions for both the first and last frames in conjunction with text instructions for video generation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that PixelDance trained with public data exhibits significantly better proficiency in synthesizing videos with complex scenes and intricate motions setting a new standard for video generation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zeng_Make_Pixels_Dance_High-Dynamic_Video_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
A&B BNN: Add&Bit-Operation-Only Hardware-Friendly Binary Neural Network,"Ma, Ruichen, Qiao, Guanchao, Liu, Yian, Meng, Liwei, Ning, Ning, Liu, Yang, Hu, Shaogang",Binary neural networks utilize 1-bit quantized weights and activations to reduce both the model's storage demands and computational burden. However advanced binary architectures still incorporate millions of inefficient and nonhardware-friendly full-precision multiplication operations. A&B BNN is proposed to directly remove part of the multiplication operations in a traditional BNN and replace the rest with an equal number of bit operations introducing the mask layer and the quantized RPReLU structure based on the normalizer-free network architecture. The mask layer can be removed during inference by leveraging the intrinsic characteristics of BNN with straightforward mathematical transformations to avoid the associated multiplication operations. The quantized RPReLU structure enables more efficient bit operations by constraining its slope to be integer powers of 2. Experimental results achieved 92.30% 69.35% and 66.89% on the CIFAR-10 CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets respectively which are competitive with the state-of-the-art. Ablation studies have verified the efficacy of the quantized RPReLU structure leading to a 1.14% enhancement on the ImageNet compared to using a fixed slope RLeakyReLU. The proposed add&bit-operation-only BNN offers an innovative approach for hardware-friendly network architecture.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ma_AB_BNN_AddBit-Operation-Only_Hardware-Friendly_Binary_Neural_Network_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Task-aligned Part-aware Panoptic Segmentation through Joint Object-Part Representations,"de Geus, Daan, Dubbelman, Gijs",Part-aware panoptic segmentation (PPS) requires (a) that each foreground object and background region in an image is segmented and classified and (b) that all parts within foreground objects are segmented classified and linked to their parent object. Existing methods approach PPS by separately conducting object-level and part-level segmentation. However their part-level predictions are not linked to individual parent objects. Therefore their learning objective is not aligned with the PPS task objective which harms the PPS performance. To solve this and make more accurate PPS predictions we propose Task-Aligned Part-aware Panoptic Segmentation (TAPPS). This method uses a set of shared queries to jointly predict (a) object-level segments and (b) the part-level segments within those same objects. As a result TAPPS learns to predict part-level segments that are linked to individual parent objects aligning the learning objective with the task objective and allowing TAPPS to leverage joint object-part representations. With experiments we show that TAPPS considerably outperforms methods that predict objects and parts separately and achieves new state-of-the-art PPS results.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/de_Geus_Task-aligned_Part-aware_Panoptic_Segmentation_through_Joint_Object-Part_Representations_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

This article aims to address this gap by delving into the intricate interplay between initialization and activation providing a foundational basis for the robust optimization of Neural Fields.

DiffAvatar: Simulation-Ready Garment Optimization with Differentiable Simulation,"Li, Yifei, Chen, Hsiao-yu, Larionov, Egor, Sarafianos, Nikolaos, Matusik, Wojciech, Stuyck, Tuur",The realism of digital avatars is crucial in enabling telepresence applications with self-expression and customization. While physical simulations can produce realistic motions for clothed humans they require high-quality garment assets with associated physical parameters for cloth simulations. However manually creating these assets and calibrating their parameters is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. Current methods focus on reconstructing geometry but don't generate complete assets for physics-based applications. To address this gap we propose DiffAvatar a novel approach that performs body and garment co-optimization using differentiable simulation. By integrating physical simulation into the optimization loop and accounting for the complex nonlinear behavior of cloth and its intricate interaction with the body our framework recovers body and garment geometry and extracts important material parameters in a physically plausible way. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach generates realistic clothing and body shape suitable for downstream applications. We provide additional insights and results on our webpage: people.csail.mit.edu/liyifei/publication/diffavatar.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_DiffAvatar_Simulation-Ready_Garment_Optimization_with_Differentiable_Simulation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AlignSAM: Aligning Segment Anything Model to Open Context via Reinforcement Learning,"Huang, Duojun, Xiong, Xinyu, Ma, Jie, Li, Jichang, Jie, Zequn, Ma, Lin, Li, Guanbin",Powered by massive curated training data Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated its impressive generalization capabilities in open-world scenarios with the guidance of prompts. However the vanilla SAM is class-agnostic and heavily relies on user-provided prompts to segment objects of interest. Adapting this method to diverse tasks is crucial for accurate target identification and to avoid suboptimal segmentation results. In this paper we propose a novel framework termed AlignSAM designed for automatic prompting for aligning SAM to an open context through reinforcement learning. Anchored by an agent AlignSAM enables the generality of the SAM model across diverse downstream tasks while keeping its parameters frozen. Specifically AlignSAM initiates a prompting agent to iteratively refine segmentation predictions by interacting with the foundational model. It integrates a reinforcement learning policy network to provide informative prompts to the foundational models. Additionally a semantic recalibration module is introduced to provide fine-grained labels of prompts enhancing the model's proficiency in handling tasks encompassing explicit and implicit semantics. Experiments conducted on various challenging segmentation tasks among existing foundation models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AlignSAM over state-of-the-art approaches.

Learning Spatial Adaptation and Temporal Coherence in Diffusion Models for Video Super-Resolution,"Chen, Zhikai, Long, Fuchen, Qiu, Zhaofan, Yao, Ting, Zhou, Wengang, Luo, Jiebo, Mei, Tao",Diffusion models are just at a tipping point for image super-resolution task. Nevertheless it is not trivial to capitalize on diffusion models for video super-resolution which necessitates not only the preservation of visual appearance from low-resolution to high-resolution videos but also the temporal consistency across video frames. In this paper we propose a novel approach pursuing Spatial Adaptation and Temporal Coherence (SATeCo) for video super-resolution. SATeCo pivots on learning spatial-temporal guidance from low-resolution videos to calibrate both latent-space high-resolution video denoising and pixel-space video reconstruction. Technically SATeCo freezes all the parameters of the pre-trained UNet and VAE and only optimizes two deliberately-designed spatial feature adaptation (SFA) and temporal feature alignment (TFA) modules in the decoder of UNet and VAE. SFA modulates frame features via adaptively estimating affine parameters for each pixel guaranteeing pixel-wise guidance for high-resolution frame synthesis. TFA delves into feature interaction within a 3D local window (tubelet) through self-attention and executes cross-attention between tubelet and its low-resolution counterpart to guide temporal feature alignment. Extensive experiments conducted on the REDS4 and Vid4 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Learning_Spatial_Adaptation_and_Temporal_Coherence_in_Diffusion_Models_for_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Denoising Point Clouds in Latent Space via Graph Convolution and Invertible Neural Network,"Mao, Aihua, Yan, Biao, Ma, Zijing, He, Ying",Point clouds frequently contain noise and outliers presenting obstacles for downstream applications. In this work we introduce a novel denoising method for point clouds. By leveraging the latent space we explicitly uncover noise components allowing for the extraction of a clean latent code. This in turn facilitates the restoration of clean points via inverse transformation. A key component in our network is a new multi-level graph convolution network for capturing rich geometric structural features at various scales from local to global. These features are then integrated into the invertible neural network which bijectively maps the latent space to guide the noise disentanglement process. Additionally we employ an invertible monotone operator to model the transformation process effectively enhancing the representation of integrated geometric features. This enhancement allows our network to precisely differentiate between noise factors and the intrinsic clean points in the latent code by projecting them onto separate channels. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods at various noise levels.

HIR-Diff: Unsupervised Hyperspectral Image Restoration Via Improved Diffusion Models,"Pang, Li, Rui, Xiangyu, Cui, Long, Wang, Hongzhong, Meng, Deyu, Cao, Xiangyong",Hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims at recovering clean images from degraded observations and plays a vital role in downstream tasks. Existing model-based methods have limitations in accurately modeling the complex image characteristics with handcraft priors and deep learning-based methods suffer from poor generalization ability. To alleviate these issues this paper proposes an unsupervised HSI restoration framework with pre-trained diffusion model (HIR-Diff) which restores the clean HSIs from the product of two low-rank components i.e. the reduced image and the coefficient matrix. Specifically the reduced image which has a low spectral dimension lies in the image field and can be inferred from our improved diffusion model where a new guidance function with total variation (TV) prior is designed to ensure that the reduced image can be well sampled. The coefficient matrix can be effectively pre-estimated based on singular value decomposition (SVD) and rank-revealing QR (RRQR) factorization. Furthermore a novel exponential noise schedule is proposed to accelerate the restoration process (about 5xacceleration for denoising) with little performance decrease. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of our method in both performance and speed on a variety of HSI restoration tasks including HSI denoising noisy HSI super-resolution and noisy HSI inpainting.

FreeDrag: Feature Dragging for Reliable Point-based Image Editing,"Ling, Pengyang, Chen, Lin, Zhang, Pan, Chen, Huaian, Jin, Yi, Zheng, Jinjin","To serve the intricate and varied demands of image editing precise and flexible manipulation in image content is indispensable. Recently Drag-based editing methods have gained impressive performance. However these methods predominantly center on point dragging resulting in two noteworthy drawbacks namely ""miss tracking"" where difficulties arise in accurately tracking the predetermined handle points and ""ambiguous tracking"" where tracked points are potentially positioned in wrong regions that closely resemble the handle points. To address the above issues we propose FreeDrag a feature dragging methodology designed to free the burden on point tracking. The FreeDrag incorporates two key designs i.e. template feature via adaptive updating and line search with backtracking the former improves the stability against drastic content change by elaborately controlling the feature updating scale after each dragging while the latter alleviates the misguidance from similar points by actively restricting the search area in a line. These two technologies together contribute to a more stable semantic dragging with higher efficiency. Comprehensive experimental results substantiate that our approach significantly outperforms pre-existing methodologies offering reliable point-based editing even in various complex scenarios.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ling_FreeDrag_Feature_Dragging_for_Reliable_Point-based_Image_Editing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Confronting Ambiguity in 6D Object Pose Estimation via Score-Based Diffusion on SE(3),"Hsiao, Tsu-Ching, Chen, Hao-Wei, Yang, Hsuan-Kung, Lee, Chun-Yi",Addressing pose ambiguity in 6D object pose estimation from single RGB images presents a significant challenge particularly due to object symmetries or occlusions. In response we introduce a novel score-based diffusion method applied to the SE(3) group marking the first application of diffusion models to SE(3) within the image domain specifically tailored for pose estimation tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the method's efficacy in handling pose ambiguity mitigating perspective-induced ambiguity and showcasing the robustness of our surrogate Stein score formulation on SE(3). This formulation not only improves the convergence of denoising process but also enhances computational efficiency.

DiffInDScene: Diffusion-based High-Quality 3D Indoor Scene Generation,"Ju, Xiaoliang, Huang, Zhaoyang, Li, Yijin, Zhang, Guofeng, Qiao, Yu, Li, Hongsheng",We present DiffInDScene a novel framework for tackling the problem of high-quality 3D indoor scene generation which is challenging due to the complexity and diversity of the indoor scene geometry. Although diffusion-based generative models have previously demonstrated impressive performance in image generation and object-level 3D generation they have not yet been applied to room-level 3D generation due to their computationally intensive costs. In DiffInDScene we propose a cascaded 3D diffusion pipeline that is efficient and possesses strong generative performance for Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF). The whole pipeline is designed to run on a sparse occupancy space in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Inspired by KinectFusion's incremental alignment and fusion of local TSDF volumes we propose a diffusion-based SDF fusion approach that iteratively diffuses and fuses local TSDF volumes facilitating the generation of an entire room environment. The generated results demonstrate that our work is capable to achieve high-quality room generation directly in three-dimensional space starting from scratch. In addition to the scene generation the final part of DiffInDScene can be used as a post-processing module to refine the 3D reconstruction results from multi-view stereo. According to the user study the mesh quality generated by our DiffInDScene can even outperform the ground truth mesh provided by ScanNet.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ju_DiffInDScene_Diffusion-based_High-Quality_3D_Indoor_Scene_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MAPSeg: Unified Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Heterogeneous Medical Image Segmentation Based on 3D Masked Autoencoding and Pseudo-Labeling,"Zhang, Xuzhe, Wu, Yuhao, Angelini, Elsa, Li, Ang, Guo, Jia, Rasmussen, Jerod M., O'Connor, Thomas G., Wadhwa, Pathik D., Jackowski, Andrea Parolin, Li, Hai, Posner, Jonathan, Laine, Andrew F., Wang, Yun",Robust segmentation is critical for deriving quantitative measures from large-scale multi-center and longitudinal medical scans. Manually annotating medical scans however is expensive and labor-intensive and may not always be available in every domain. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a well-studied technique that alleviates this label-scarcity problem by leveraging available labels from another domain. In this study we introduce Masked Autoencoding and Pseudo-Labeling Segmentation (MAPSeg) a unified UDA framework with great versatility and superior performance for heterogeneous and volumetric medical image segmentation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that systematically reviews and develops a framework to tackle four different domain shifts in medical image segmentation. More importantly MAPSeg is the first framework that can be applied to centralized federated and test-time UDA while maintaining comparable performance. We compare MAPSeg with previous state-of-the-art methods on a private infant brain MRI dataset and a public cardiac CT-MRI dataset and MAPSeg outperforms others by a large margin (10.5 Dice improvement on the private MRI dataset and 5.7 on the public CT-MRI dataset).

DaReNeRF: Direction-aware Representation for Dynamic Scenes,"Lou, Ange, Planche, Benjamin, Gao, Zhongpai, Li, Yamin, Luan, Tianyu, Ding, Hao, Chen, Terrence, Noble, Jack, Wu, Ziyan",Addressing the intricate challenge of modeling and re-rendering dynamic scenes most recent approaches have sought to simplify these complexities using plane-based explicit representations overcoming the slow training time issues associated with methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and implicit representations. However the straightforward decomposition of 4D dynamic scenes into multiple 2D plane-based representations proves insufficient for re-rendering high-fidelity scenes with complex motions. In response we present a novel direction-aware representation (DaRe) approach that captures scene dynamics from six different directions. This learned representation undergoes an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover plane-based information. DaReNeRF computes features for each space-time point by fusing vectors from these recovered planes. Combining DaReNeRF with a tiny MLP for color regression and leveraging volume rendering in training yield state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for complex dynamic scenes. Notably to address redundancy introduced by the six real and six imaginary direction-aware wavelet coefficients we introduce a trainable masking approach mitigating storage issues without significant performance decline. Moreover DaReNeRF maintains a 2x reduction in training time compared to prior art while delivering superior performance.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lou_DaReNeRF_Direction-aware_Representation_for_Dynamic_Scenes_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SfmCAD: Unsupervised CAD Reconstruction by Learning Sketch-based Feature Modeling Operations,"Li, Pu, Guo, Jianwei, Li, Huibin, Benes, Bedrich, Yan, Dong-Ming",This paper introduces SfmCAD a novel unsupervised network that reconstructs 3D shapes by learning the Sketch-based Feature Modeling operations commonly used in modern CAD workflows. Given a 3D shape represented as voxels SfmCAD learns a neural-typed sketch+path parameterized representation including 2D sketches of feature primitives and their 3D sweeping paths without supervision for inferring feature-based CAD programs. SfmCAD employs 2D sketches for local detail representation and 3D paths to capture the overall structure achieving a clear separation between shape details and structure. This conversion into parametric forms enables users to seamlessly adjust the shape's geometric and structural features thus enhancing interpretability and user control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying SfmCAD to many different types of objects such as CAD parts ShapeNet objects and tree shapes. Extensive comparisons show that SfmCAD produces compact and faithful 3D reconstructions with superior quality compared to alternatives.

Learning Degradation-unaware Representation with Prior-based Latent Transformations for Blind Face Restoration,"Xie, Lianxin, Zheng, Csbingbing, Xue, Wen, Jiang, Le, Liu, Cheng, Wu, Si, Wong, Hau San",Blind face restoration focuses on restoring high-fidelity details from images subjected to complex and unknown degradations while preserving identity information. In this paper we present a Prior-based Latent Transformation approach (PLTrans) which is specifically designed to learn a degradation-unaware representation thereby allowing the restoration network to effectively generalize to real-world degradation. Toward this end PLTrans learns a degradation-unaware query via a latent diffusion-based regularization module. Furthermore conditioned on the features of a degraded face image a latent dictionary that captures the priors of HQ face images is leveraged to refine the features by mapping the top-d nearest elements. The refined version will be used to build key and value for the cross-attention computation which is tailored to each degraded image and exhibits reduced sensitivity to different degradation factors. Conditioned on the resulting representation we train a decoding network that synthesizes face images with authentic details and identity preservation. Through extensive experiments we verify the effectiveness of the design elements and demonstrate the generalization ability of our proposed approach for both synthetic and unknown degradations. We finally demonstrate the applicability of PLTrans in other vision tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xie_Learning_Degradation-unaware_Representation_with_Prior-based_Latent_Transformations_for_Blind_Face_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Faces that Speak: Jointly Synthesising Talking Face and Speech from Text,"Jang, Youngjoon, Kim, Ji-Hoon, Ahn, Junseok, Kwak, Doyeop, Yang, Hong-Sun, Ju, Yoon-Cheol, Kim, Il-Hwan, Kim, Byeong-Yeol, Chung, Joon Son",The goal of this work is to simultaneously generate natural talking faces and speech outputs from text. We achieve this by integrating Talking Face Generation (TFG) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems into a unified framework. We address the main challenges of each task: (1) generating a range of head poses representative of real-world scenarios and (2) ensuring voice consistency despite variations in facial motion for the same identity. To tackle these issues we introduce a motion sampler based on conditional flow matching which is capable of high-quality motion code generation in an efficient way. Moreover we introduce a novel conditioning method for the TTS system which utilises motion-removed features from the TFG model to yield uniform speech outputs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively creates natural-looking talking faces and speech that accurately match the input text. To our knowledge this is the first effort to build a multimodal synthesis system that can generalise to unseen identities.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jang_Faces_that_Speak_Jointly_Synthesising_Talking_Face_and_Speech_from_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DiffusionRegPose: Enhancing Multi-Person Pose Estimation using a Diffusion-Based End-to-End Regression Approach,"Tan, Dayi, Chen, Hansheng, Tian, Wei, Xiong, Lu",This paper presents the DiffusionRegPose a novel approach to multi-person pose estimation that converts a one-stage end-to-end keypoint regression model into a diffusion-based sampling process. Existing one-stage deterministic regression methods though efficient are often prone to missed or false detections in crowded or occluded scenes due to their inability to reason pose ambiguity. To address these challenges we handle ambiguous poses in a generative fashion i.e. sampling from the image-conditioned pose distributions characterized by a diffusion probabilistic model. Specifically with initial pose tokens extracted from the image noisy pose candidates are progressively refined by interacting with the initial tokens via attention layers. Extensive evaluations on the COCO and CrowdPose datasets show that DiffusionRegPose clearly improves the pose accuracy in crowded scenarios as evidenced by a notable 4.0 AP increase in the AP_H metric on the CrowdPose dataset. This demonstrates the model's potential for robust and precise human pose estimation in real-world applications.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Tan_DiffusionRegPose_Enhancing_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation_using_a_Diffusion-Based_End-to-End_Regression_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Memory-Scalable and Simplified Functional Map Learning,"Magnet, Robin, Ovsjanikov, Maks",Deep functional maps have emerged in recent years as a prominent learning-based framework for non-rigid shape matching problems. While early methods in this domain only focused on learning in the functional domain the latest techniques have demonstrated that by promoting consistency between functional and pointwise maps leads to significant improvements in accuracy. Unfortunately existing approaches rely heavily on the computation of large dense matrices arising from soft pointwise maps which compromises their efficiency and scalability. To address this limitation we introduce a novel memory-scalable and efficient functional map learning pipeline. By leveraging the specific structure of functional maps we offer the possibility to achieve identical results without ever storing the pointwise map in memory. Furthermore based on the same approach we present a differentiable map refinement layer adapted from an existing axiomatic refinement algorithm. Unlike many functional map learning methods which use this algorithm at a post-processing step ours can be easily used at train time enabling to enforce consistency between the refined and initial versions of the map. Our resulting approach is both simpler more efficient and more numerically stable by avoiding differentiation through a linear system while achieving close to state-of-the-art results in challenging scenarios.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Magnet_Memory-Scalable_and_Simplified_Functional_Map_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Gaussian Head Avatar: Ultra High-fidelity Head Avatar via Dynamic Gaussians,"Xu, Yuelang, Chen, Benwang, Li, Zhe, Zhang, Hongwen, Wang, Lizhen, Zheng, Zerong, Liu, Yebin",Creating high-fidelity 3D head avatars has always been a research hotspot but there remains a great challenge under lightweight sparse view setups. In this paper we propose Gaussian Head Avatar represented by controllable 3D Gaussians for high-fidelity head avatar modeling. We optimize the neutral 3D Gaussians and a fully learned MLP-based deformation field to capture complex expressions. The two parts benefit each other thereby our method can model fine-grained dynamic details while ensuring expression accuracy. Furthermore we devise a well-designed geometry-guided initialization strategy based on implicit SDF and Deep Marching Tetrahedra for the stability and convergence of the training procedure. Experiments show our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art sparse-view methods achieving ultra high-fidelity rendering quality at 2K resolution even under exaggerated expressions.

Stratified Avatar Generation from Sparse Observations,"Feng, Han, Ma, Wenchao, Gao, Quankai, Zheng, Xianwei, Xue, Nan, Xu, Huijuan",Estimating 3D full-body avatars from AR/VR devices is essential for creating immersive experiences in AR/VR applications. This task is challenging due to the limited input from Head Mounted Devices which capture only sparse observations from the head and hands. Predicting the full-body avatars particularly the lower body from these sparse observations presents significant difficulties. In this paper we are inspired by the inherent property of the kinematic tree defined in the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model where the upper body and lower body share only one common ancestor node bringing the potential of decoupled reconstruction. We propose a stratified approach to decouple the conventional full-body avatar reconstruction pipeline into two stages with the reconstruction of the upper body first and a subsequent reconstruction of the lower body conditioned on the previous stage. To implement this straightforward idea we leverage the latent diffusion model as a powerful probabilistic generator and train it to follow the latent distribution of decoupled motions explored by a VQ-VAE encoder-decoder model. Extensive experiments on AMASS mocap dataset demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance in the reconstruction of full-body motions.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Feng_Stratified_Avatar_Generation_from_Sparse_Observations_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Rewrite the Stars,"Ma, Xu, Dai, Xiyang, Bai, Yue, Wang, Yizhou, Fu, Yun","Recent studies have drawn attention to the untapped potential of the ""star operation"" (element-wise multiplication) in network design. While intuitive explanations abound the foundational rationale behind its application remains largely unexplored. Our study attempts to reveal the star operation's ability of mapping inputs into high-dimensional non-linear feature spaces--akin to kernel tricks--without widening the network. We further introduce StarNet a simple yet powerful prototype demonstrating impressive performance and low latency under compact network structure and efficient budget. Like stars in the sky the star operation appears unremarkable but holds a vast universe of potential.

PairDETR : Joint Detection and Association of Human Bodies and Faces,"Ali, Ammar, Gaikov, Georgii, Rybalchenko, Denis, Chigorin, Alexander, Laptev, Ivan, Zagoruyko, Sergey",Image and video analysis requires not only accurate object but also the understanding of relationships among detected objects. Common solutions to relation modeling typically resort to stand-alone object detectors followed by non-differentiable post-processing techniques. Recently introduced detection transformers (DETR) perform end-to-end object detection based on a bipartite matching loss. Such methods however lack the ability to jointly detect objects and resolve object associations. In this paper we build on the DETR approach and extend it to the joint detection of objects and their relationships by introducing an approximated bipartite matching. While our method can generalize to an arbitrary number of objects we here focus on the modeling of object pairs and their relations. In particular we apply our method PairDETR to the problem of detecting human bodies and faces and associating them for the same person. Our approach not only eliminates the need for hand-designed post-processing but also achieves excellent results for body-face associations. We evaluate PairDETR on the challenging CrowdHuman and CityPersons datasets and demonstrate a large improvement over the state of the art. Our training code and pre-trained models are available online.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ali_PairDETR__Joint_Detection_and_Association_of_Human_Bodies_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Text2HOI: Text-guided 3D Motion Generation for Hand-Object Interaction,"Cha, Junuk, Kim, Jihyeon, Yoon, Jae Shin, Baek, Seungryul",This paper introduces the first text-guided work for generating the sequence of hand-object interaction in 3D. The main challenge arises from the lack of labeled data where existing ground-truth datasets are nowhere near generalizable in interaction type and object category which inhibits the modeling of diverse 3D hand-object interaction with the correct physical implication (e.g. contacts and semantics) from text prompts. To address this challenge we propose to decompose the interaction generation task into two subtasks: hand-object contact generation; and hand-object motion generation. For contact generation a VAE-based network takes as input a text and an object mesh and generates the probability of contacts between the surfaces of hands and the object during the interaction. The network learns a variety of local geometry structure of diverse objects that is independent of the objects' category and thus it is applicable to general objects. For motion generation a Transformer-based diffusion model utilizes this 3D contact map as a strong prior for generating physically plausible hand-object motion as a function of text prompts by learning from the augmented labeled dataset; where we annotate text labels from many existing 3D hand and object motion data. Finally we further introduce a hand refiner module that minimizes the distance between the object surface and hand joints to improve the temporal stability of the object-hand contacts and to suppress the penetration artifacts. In the experiments we demonstrate that our method can generate more realistic and diverse interactions compared to other baseline methods. We also show that our method is applicable to unseen objects. We will release our model and newly labeled data as a strong foundation for future research.

MACE: Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models,"Lu, Shilin, Wang, Zilan, Li, Leyang, Liu, Yanzhu, Kong, Adams Wai-Kin",The rapid expansion of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has raised growing concerns regarding their potential misuse in creating harmful or misleading content. In this paper we introduce MACE a finetuning framework for the task of mass concept erasure. This task aims to prevent models from generating images that embody unwanted concepts when prompted. Existing concept erasure methods are typically restricted to handling fewer than five concepts simultaneously and struggle to find a balance between erasing concept synonyms (generality) and maintaining unrelated concepts (specificity). In contrast MACE differs by successfully scaling the erasure scope up to 100 concepts and by achieving an effective balance between generality and specificity. This is achieved by leveraging closed-form cross-attention refinement along with LoRA finetuning collectively eliminating the information of undesirable concepts. Furthermore MACE integrates multiple LoRAs without mutual interference. We conduct extensive evaluations of MACE against prior methods across four different tasks: object erasure celebrity erasure explicit content erasure and artistic style erasure. Our results reveal that MACE surpasses prior methods in all evaluated tasks.

PeLK: Parameter-efficient Large Kernel ConvNets with Peripheral Convolution,"Chen, Honghao, Chu, Xiangxiang, Ren, Yongjian, Zhao, Xin, Huang, Kaiqi",Recently some large kernel convnets strike back with appealing performance and efficiency. However given the square complexity of convolution scaling up kernels can bring about an enormous amount of parameters and the proliferated parameters can induce severe optimization problem. Due to these issues current CNNs compromise to scale up to 51x51 in the form of stripe convolution (i.e. 51x5+5x51) and start to saturate as the kernel size continues growing. In this paper we delve into addressing these vital issues and explore whether we can continue scaling up kernels for more performance gains. Inspired by human vision we propose a human-like peripheral convolution that efficiently reduces over 90% parameter count of dense grid convolution through parameter sharing and manage to scale up kernel size to extremely large. Our peripheral convolution behaves highly similar to human reducing the complexity of convolution from O(K^2) to O(logK) without backfiring performance. Built on this we propose Parameter-efficient Large Kernel Network (PeLK). Our PeLK outperforms modern vision Transformers and ConvNet architectures like Swin ConvNeXt RepLKNet and SLaK on various vision tasks including ImageNet classification semantic segmentation on ADE20K and object detection on MS COCO. For the first time we successfully scale up the kernel size of CNNs to an unprecedented 101x101 and demonstrate consistent improvements.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_PeLK_Parameter-efficient_Large_Kernel_ConvNets_with_Peripheral_Convolution_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AiOS: All-in-One-Stage Expressive Human Pose and Shape Estimation,"Sun, Qingping, Wang, Yanjun, Zeng, Ailing, Yin, Wanqi, Wei, Chen, Wang, Wenjia, Mei, Haiyi, Leung, Chi-Sing, Liu, Ziwei, Yang, Lei, Cai, Zhongang",Expressive human pose and shape estimation (a.k.a. 3D whole-body mesh recovery) involves the human body hand and expression estimation. Most existing methods have tackled this task in a two-stage manner first detecting the human body part with an off-the-shelf detection model and then inferring the different human body parts individually. Despite the impressive results achieved these methods suffer from 1) loss of valuable contextual information via cropping 2) introducing distractions and 3) lacking inter-association among different persons and body parts inevitably causing performance degradation especially for crowded scenes. To address these issues we introduce a novel all-in-one-stage framework AiOS for multiple expressive human pose and shape recovery without an additional human detection step. Specifically our method is built upon DETR which treats multi-person whole-body mesh recovery task as a progressive set prediction problem with various sequential detection. We devise the decoder tokens and extend them to our task. Specifically we first employ a human token to probe a human location in the image and encode global features for each instance which provides a coarse location for the later transformer block. Then we introduce a joint-related token to probe the human joint in the image and encoder a fine-grained local feature which collaborates with the global feature to regress the whole-body mesh. This straightforward but effective model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a 9 reduction in NMVE on AGORA a 30 reduction in PVE on EHF a 10 reduction in PVE on ARCTIC and a 3 reduction in PVE on EgoBody.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sun_AiOS_All-in-One-Stage_Expressive_Human_Pose_and_Shape_Estimation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Design2Cloth: 3D Cloth Generation from 2D Masks,"Zheng, Jiali, Potamias, Rolandos Alexandros, Zafeiriou, Stefanos",In recent years there has been a significant shift in the field of digital avatar research towards modeling animating and reconstructing clothed human representations as a key step towards creating realistic avatars. However current 3D cloth generation methods are garment specific or trained completely on synthetic data hence lacking fine details and realism. In this work we make a step towards automatic realistic garment design and propose Design2Cloth a high fidelity 3D generative model trained on a real world dataset from more than 2000 subject scans. To provide vital contribution to the fashion industry we developed a user-friendly adversarial model capable of generating diverse and detailed clothes simply by drawing a 2D cloth mask. Under a series of both qualitative and quantitative experiments we showcase that Design2Cloth outperforms current state-of-the-art cloth generative models by a large margin. In addition to the generative properties of our network we showcase that the proposed method can be used to achieve high quality reconstructions from single in-the-wild images and 3D scans. Dataset code and pre-trained model will become publicly available.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zheng_Design2Cloth_3D_Cloth_Generation_from_2D_Masks_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Amodal Completion via Progressive Mixed Context Diffusion,"Xu, Katherine, Zhang, Lingzhi, Shi, Jianbo",Our brain can effortlessly recognize objects even when partially hidden from view. Seeing the visible of the hidden is called amodal completion; however this task remains a challenge for generative AI despite rapid progress. We propose to sidestep many of the difficulties of existing approaches which typically involve a two-step process of predicting amodal masks and then generating pixels. Our method involves thinking outside the box literally! We go outside the object bounding box to use its context to guide a pre-trained diffusion inpainting model and then progressively grow the occluded object and trim the extra background. We overcome two technical challenges: 1) how to be free of unwanted co-occurrence bias which tends to regenerate similar occluders and 2) how to judge if an amodal completion has succeeded. Our amodal completion method exhibits improved photorealistic completion results compared to existing approaches in numerous successful completion cases. And the best part? It doesn't require any special training or fine-tuning of models.

Diffusion 3D Features (Diff3F): Decorating Untextured Shapes with Distilled Semantic Features,"Dutt, Niladri Shekhar, Muralikrishnan, Sanjeev, Mitra, Niloy J.",We present Diff3F as a simple robust and class-agnostic feature descriptor that can be computed for untextured input shapes (meshes or point clouds). Our method distills diffusion features from image foundational models onto input shapes. Specifically we use the input shapes to produce depth and normal maps as guidance for conditional image synthesis. In the process we produce (diffusion) features in 2D that we subsequently lift and aggregate on the original surface. Our key observation is that even if the conditional image generations obtained from multi-view rendering of the input shapes are inconsistent the associated image features are robust and hence can be directly aggregated across views. This produces semantic features on the input shapes without requiring additional data or training. We perform extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (SHREC'19 SHREC'20 FAUST and TOSCA) and demonstrate that our features being semantic instead of geometric produce reliable correspondence across both isometric and non-isometrically related shape families.

Cinematic Behavior Transfer via NeRF-based Differentiable Filming,"Jiang, Xuekun, Rao, Anyi, Wang, Jingbo, Lin, Dahua, Dai, Bo",In the evolving landscape of digital media and video production the precise manipulation and reproduction of visual elements like camera movements and character actions are highly desired. Existing SLAM methods face limitations in dynamic scenes and human pose estimation often focuses on 2D projections neglecting 3D statuses. To address these issues we first introduce a reverse filming behavior estimation technique. It optimizes camera trajectories by leveraging NeRF as a differentiable renderer and refining SMPL tracks. We then introduce a cinematic transfer pipeline that is able to transfer various shot types to a new 2D video or a 3D virtual environment. The incorporation of 3D engine workflow enables superior rendering and control abilities which also achieves a higher rating in the user study.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jiang_Cinematic_Behavior_Transfer_via_NeRF-based_Differentiable_Filming_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Text-Driven Image Editing via Learnable Regions,"Lin, Yuanze, Chen, Yi-Wen, Tsai, Yi-Hsuan, Jiang, Lu, Yang, Ming-Hsuan",Language has emerged as a natural interface for image editing. In this paper we introduce a method for region-based image editing driven by textual prompts without the need for user-provided masks or sketches. Specifically our approach leverages an existing pre-trained text-to-image model and introduces a bounding box generator to identify the editing regions that are aligned with the textual prompts. We show that this simple approach enables flexible editing that is compatible with current image generation models and is able to handle complex prompts featuring multiple objects complex sentences or lengthy paragraphs. We conduct an extensive user study to compare our method against state-of-the-art methods. The experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our method in manipulating images with high fidelity and realism that correspond to the provided language descriptions.

Relation Rectification in Diffusion Model,"Wu, Yinwei, Yang, Xingyi, Wang, Xinchao",Despite their exceptional generative abilities large T2I diffusion models much like skilled but careless artists often struggle with accurately depicting visual relationships between objects. This issue as we uncover through careful analysis arises from a misaligned text encoder that struggles to interpret specific relationships and differentiate the logical order of associated objects. To resolve this we introduce a novel task termed Relation Rectification aiming to refine the model to accurately represent a given relationship it initially fails to generate. To address this we propose an innovative solution utilizing a Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (HGCN). It models the directional relationships between relation terms and corresponding objects within the input prompts. Specifically we optimize the HGCN on a pair of prompts with identical relational words but reversed object orders supplemented by a few reference images. The lightweight HGCN adjusts the text embeddings generated by the text encoder ensuring accurate reflection of the textual relation in the embedding space. Crucially our method retains the parameters of the text encoder and diffusion model preserving the model's robust performance on unrelated descriptions. We validated our approach on a newly curated dataset of diverse relational data demonstrating both quantitative and qualitative enhancements in generating images with precise visual relations.

Mocap Everyone Everywhere: Lightweight Motion Capture With Smartwatches and a Head-Mounted Camera,"Lee, Jiye, Joo, Hanbyul",We present a lightweight and affordable motion capture method based on two smartwatches and a head-mounted camera. In contrast to the existing approaches that use six or more expert-level IMU devices our approach is much more cost-effective and convenient. Our method can make wearable motion capture accessible to everyone everywhere enabling 3D full-body motion capture in diverse environments. As a key idea to overcome the extreme sparsity and ambiguities of sensor inputs with different modalities we integrate 6D head poses obtained from the head-mounted cameras for motion estimation. To enable capture in expansive indoor and outdoor scenes we propose an algorithm to track and update floor level changes to define head poses coupled with a multi-stage Transformer-based regression module. We also introduce novel strategies leveraging visual cues of egocentric images to further enhance the motion capture quality while reducing ambiguities. We demonstrate the performance of our method on various challenging scenarios including complex outdoor environments and everyday motions including object interactions and social interactions among multiple individuals.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_Mocap_Everyone_Everywhere_Lightweight_Motion_Capture_With_Smartwatches_and_a_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Fast ODE-based Sampling for Diffusion Models in Around 5 Steps,"Zhou, Zhenyu, Chen, Defang, Wang, Can, Chen, Chun",Sampling from diffusion models can be treated as solving the corresponding ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with the aim of obtaining an accurate solution with as few number of function evaluations (NFE) as possible. Recently various fast samplers utilizing higher-order ODE solvers have emerged and achieved better performance than the initial first-order one. However these numerical methods inherently result in certain approximation errors which significantly degrades sample quality with extremely small NFE (e.g. around 5). In contrast based on the geometric observation that each sampling trajectory almost lies in a two-dimensional subspace embedded in the ambient space we propose Approximate MEan-Direction Solver (AMED-Solver) that eliminates truncation errors by directly learning the mean direction for fast diffusion sampling. Besides our method can be easily used as a plugin to further improve existing ODE-based samplers. Extensive experiments on image synthesis with the resolution ranging from 32 to 512 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. With only 5 NFE we achieve 6.61 FID on CIFAR-10 10.74 FID on ImageNet 64x64 and 13.20 FID on LSUN Bedroom.

CLiC: Concept Learning in Context,"Safaee, Mehdi, Mikaeili, Aryan, Patashnik, Or, Cohen-Or, Daniel, Mahdavi-Amiri, Ali",This paper addresses the challenge of learning a local visual pattern of an object from one image and generating images depicting objects with that pattern. Learning a localized concept and placing it on an object in a target image is a nontrivial task as the objects may have different orientations and shapes. Our approach builds upon recent advancements in visual concept learning. It involves acquiring a visual concept (e.g. an ornament) from a source image and subsequently applying it to an object (e.g. a chair) in a target image. Our key idea is to perform in-context concept learning acquiring the local visual concept within the broader context of the objects they belong to. To localize the concept learning we employ soft masks that contain both the concept within the mask and the surrounding image area. We demonstrate our approach through object generation within an image showcasing plausible embedding of in-context learned concepts. We also introduce methods for directing acquired concepts to specific locations within target images employing cross-attention mechanisms and establishing correspondences between source and target objects. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative experiments along with comparisons against baseline techniques.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Safaee_CLiC_Concept_Learning_in_Context_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CAD-SIGNet: CAD Language Inference from Point Clouds using Layer-wise Sketch Instance Guided Attention,"Khan, Mohammad Sadil, Dupont, Elona, Ali, Sk Aziz, Cherenkova, Kseniya, Kacem, Anis, Aouada, Djamila",Reverse engineering in the realm of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) has been a longstanding aspiration though not yet entirely realized. Its primary aim is to uncover the CAD process behind a physical object given its 3D scan. We propose CAD-SIGNet an end-to-end trainable and auto-regressive architecture to recover the design history of a CAD model represented as a sequence of sketch- and-extrusion from an input point cloud. Our model learns CAD visual-language representations by layer-wise cross-attention between point cloud and CAD language embedding. In particular a new Sketch instance Guided Attention (SGA) module is proposed in order to reconstruct the fine- grained details of the sketches. Thanks to its auto-regressive nature CAD-SIGNet not only reconstructs a unique full design history of the corresponding CAD model given an in- put point cloud but also provides multiple plausible design choices.

CLIB-FIQA: Face Image Quality Assessment with Confidence Calibration,"Ou, Fu-Zhao, Li, Chongyi, Wang, Shiqi, Kwong, Sam",Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) is pivotal for guaranteeing the accuracy of face recognition in unconstrained environments. Recent progress in deep quality-fitting-based methods that train models to align with quality anchors has shown promise in FIQA. However these methods heavily depend on a recognition model to yield quality anchors and indiscriminately treat the confidence of inaccurate anchors as equivalent to that of accurate ones during the FIQA model training leading to a fitting bottleneck issue. This paper seeks a solution by putting forward the Confidence-Calibrated Face Image Quality Assessment (CLIB-FIQA) approach underpinned by the synergistic interplay between the quality anchors and objective quality factors such as blur pose expression occlusion and illumination. Specifically we devise a joint learning framework built upon the vision-language alignment model which leverages the joint distribution with multiple quality factors to facilitate the quality fitting of the FIQA model. Furthermore to alleviate the issue of the model placing excessive trust in inaccurate quality anchors we propose a confidence calibration method to correct the quality distribution by exploiting to the fullest extent of these objective quality factors characterized as the merged-factor distribution during training. Experimental results on eight datasets reveal the superior performance of the proposed method.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ou_CLIB-FIQA_Face_Image_Quality_Assessment_with_Confidence_Calibration_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Predicated Diffusion: Predicate Logic-Based Attention Guidance for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Sueyoshi, Kota, Matsubara, Takashi",Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality diverse and creative images. However in text-based image generation they often struggle to accurately capture the intended meaning of the text. For instance a specified object might not be generated or an adjective might incorrectly alter unintended objects. Moreover we found that relationships indicating possession between objects are frequently overlooked. Despite the diversity of users' intentions in text existing methods often focus on only some aspects of these intentions. In this paper we propose Predicated Diffusion a unified framework designed to more effectively express users' intentions. It represents the intended meaning as propositions using predicate logic and treats the pixels in attention maps as fuzzy predicates. This approach provides a differentiable loss function that offers guidance for the image generation process to better fulfill the propositions. Comparative evaluations with existing methods demonstrated that Predicated Diffusion excels in generating images faithful to various text prompts while maintaining high image quality as validated by human evaluators and pretrained image-text models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sueyoshi_Predicated_Diffusion_Predicate_Logic-Based_Attention_Guidance_for_Text-to-Image_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MoML: Online Meta Adaptation for 3D Human Motion Prediction,"Sun, Xiaoning, Sun, Huaijiang, Li, Bin, Wei, Dong, Li, Weiqing, Lu, Jianfeng","In the academic field the research on human motion prediction tasks mainly focuses on exploiting the observed information to forecast human movements accurately in the near future horizon. However a significant gap appears when it comes to the application field as current models are all trained offline with fixed parameters that are inherently suboptimal to handle the complex yet ever-changing nature of human behaviors. To bridge this gap in this paper we introduce the task of online meta adaptation for human motion prediction based on the insight that finding ""smart weights"" capable of swift adjustments to suit different motion contexts along the time is a key to improving predictive accuracy. We propose MoML which ingeniously borrows the bilevel optimization spirit of model-agnostic meta-learning to transform previous predictive mistakes into strong inductive biases to guide online adaptation. This is achieved by our MoAdapter blocks that can learn error information by facilitating efficient adaptation via a few gradient steps which fine-tunes our meta-learned ""smart"" initialization produced by the generic predictor. Considering real-time requirements in practice we further propose Fast-MoML a more efficient variant of MoML that features a closed-form solution instead of conventional gradient update. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively bring many existing offline motion prediction models online and improves their predictive accuracy.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sun_MoML_Online_Meta_Adaptation_for_3D_Human_Motion_Prediction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CAT-DM: Controllable Accelerated Virtual Try-on with Diffusion Model,"Zeng, Jianhao, Song, Dan, Nie, Weizhi, Tian, Hongshuo, Wang, Tongtong, Liu, An-An",Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) dominate the research field in image-based virtual try-on but have not resolved problems such as unnatural deformation of garments and the blurry generation quality. While the generative quality of diffusion models is impressive achieving controllability poses a significant challenge when applying it to virtual try-on and multiple denoising iterations limit its potential for real-time applications. In this paper we propose Controllable Accelerated virtual Try-on with Diffusion Model (CAT-DM). To enhance the controllability a basic diffusion-based virtual try-on network is designed which utilizes ControlNet to introduce additional control conditions and improves the feature extraction of garment images. In terms of acceleration CAT-DM initiates a reverse denoising process with an implicit distribution generated by a pre-trained GAN-based model. Compared with previous try-on methods based on diffusion models CAT-DM not only retains the pattern and texture details of the in-shop garment but also reduces the sampling steps without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CAT-DM against both GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in producing more realistic images and accurately reproducing garment patterns.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zeng_CAT-DM_Controllable_Accelerated_Virtual_Try-on_with_Diffusion_Model_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Synergistic Global-space Camera and Human Reconstruction from Videos,"Zhao, Yizhou, Wang, Tuanfeng Yang, Raj, Bhiksha, Xu, Min, Yang, Jimei, Huang, Chun-Hao Paul",Remarkable strides have been made in reconstructing static scenes or human bodies from monocular videos. Yet the two problems have largely been approached independently without much synergy. Most visual SLAM methods can only reconstruct camera trajectories and scene structures up to scale while most HMR methods reconstruct human meshes in metric scale but fall short in reasoning with cameras and scenes. This work introduces Synergistic Camera and Human Reconstruction (SynCHMR) to marry the best of both worlds. Specifically we design Human-aware Metric SLAM to reconstruct metric-scale camera poses and scene point clouds using camera-frame HMR as a strong prior addressing depth scale and dynamic ambiguities. Conditioning on the dense scene recovered we further learn a Scene-aware SMPL Denoiser to enhance world-frame HMR by incorporating spatiotemporal coherency and dynamic scene constraints. Together they lead to consistent reconstructions of camera trajectories human meshes and dense scene point clouds in a common world frame.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhao_Synergistic_Global-space_Camera_and_Human_Reconstruction_from_Videos_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
3D Face Reconstruction with the Geometric Guidance of Facial Part Segmentation,"Wang, Zidu, Zhu, Xiangyu, Zhang, Tianshuo, Wang, Baiqin, Lei, Zhen",3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) provide promising 3D face reconstructions in various applications. However existing methods struggle to reconstruct faces with extreme expressions due to deficiencies in supervisory signals such as sparse or inaccurate landmarks. Segmentation information contains effective geometric contexts for face reconstruction. Certain attempts intuitively depend on differentiable renderers to compare the rendered silhouettes of reconstruction with segmentation which is prone to issues like local optima and gradient instability. In this paper we fully utilize the facial part segmentation geometry by introducing Part Re-projection Distance Loss (PRDL). Specifically PRDL transforms facial part segmentation into 2D points and re-projects the reconstruction onto the image plane. Subsequently by introducing grid anchors and computing different statistical distances from these anchors to the point sets PRDL establishes geometry descriptors to optimize the distribution of the point sets for face reconstruction. PRDL exhibits a clear gradient compared to the renderer-based methods and presents state-of-the-art reconstruction performance in extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments. Our project is available at https://github.com/wang-zidu/3DDFA-V3.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_3D_Face_Reconstruction_with_the_Geometric_Guidance_of_Facial_Part_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FreeU: Free Lunch in Diffusion U-Net,"Si, Chenyang, Huang, Ziqi, Jiang, Yuming, Liu, Ziwei","In this paper we uncover the untapped potential of diffusion U-Net which serves as a ""free lunch"" that substantially improves the generation quality on the fly. We initially investigate the key contributions of the U-Net architecture to the denoising process and identify that its main backbone primarily contributes to denoising whereas its skip connections mainly introduce high-frequency features into the decoder module causing the potential neglect of crucial functions intrinsic to the backbone network. Capitalizing on this discovery we propose a simple yet effective method termed ""FreeU"" which enhances generation quality without additional training or finetuning. Our key insight is to strategically re-weight the contributions sourced from the U-Net's skip connections and backbone feature maps to leverage the strengths of both components of the U-Net architecture. Promising results on image and video generation tasks demonstrate that our FreeU can be readily integrated to existing diffusion models e.g. Stable Diffusion DreamBooth and ControlNet to improve the generation quality with only a few lines of code. All you need is to adjust two scaling factors during inference.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Si_FreeU_Free_Lunch_in_Diffusion_U-Net_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ViewDiff: 3D-Consistent Image Generation with Text-to-Image Models,"H√∂llein, Lukas, Bo≈æiƒç, Alja≈æ, M√ºller, Norman, Novotny, David, Tseng, Hung-Yu, Richardt, Christian, Zollh√∂fer, Michael, Nie√üner, Matthias",3D asset generation is getting massive amounts of attention inspired by the recent success on text-guided 2D content creation. Existing text-to-3D methods use pretrained text-to-image diffusion models in an optimization problem or fine-tune them on synthetic data which often results in non-photorealistic 3D objects without backgrounds. In this paper we present a method that leverages pretrained text-to-image models as a prior and learn to generate multi-view images in a single denoising process from real-world data. Concretely we propose to integrate 3D volume-rendering and cross-frame-attention layers into each block of the existing U-Net network of the text-to-image model. Moreover we design an autoregressive generation that renders more 3D-consistent images at any viewpoint. We train our model on real-world datasets of objects and showcase its capabilities to generate instances with a variety of high-quality shapes and textures in authentic surroundings. Compared to the existing methods the results generated by our method are consistent and have favorable visual quality (-30% FID -37% KID).,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hollein_ViewDiff_3D-Consistent_Image_Generation_with_Text-to-Image_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Diffusion Models Without Attention,"Yan, Jing Nathan, Gu, Jiatao, Rush, Alexander M.",In recent advancements in high-fidelity image generation Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have emerged as a key player. However their application at high resolutions presents significant computational challenges. Current methods such as patchifying expedite processes in UNet and Transformer architectures but at the expense of representational capacity. Addressing this we introduce the Diffusion State Space Model (DiffuSSM) an architecture that supplants attention mechanisms with a more scalable state space model backbone. This approach effectively handles higher resolutions without resorting to global compression thus preserving detailed image representation throughout the diffusion process. Our focus on FLOP-efficient architectures in diffusion training marks a significant step forward. Comprehensive evaluations on both ImageNet and LSUN datasets at two resolutions demonstrate that DiffuSSMs are on par or even outperform existing diffusion models with attention modules in FID and Inception Score metrics while significantly reducing total FLOP usage.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yan_Diffusion_Models_Without_Attention_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Emotional Speech-driven 3D Body Animation via Disentangled Latent Diffusion,"Chhatre, Kiran, Dan??ek, Radek, Athanasiou, Nikos, Becherini, Giorgio, Peters, Christopher, Black, Michael J., Bolkart, Timo",Existing methods for synthesizing 3D human gestures from speech have shown promising results but they do not explicitly model the impact of emotions on the generated gestures. Instead these methods directly output animations from speech without control over the expressed emotion. To address this limitation we present AMUSE an emotional speech-driven body animation model based on latent diffusion. Our observation is that content (i.e. gestures related to speech rhythm and word utterances) emotion and personal style are separable. To account for this AMUSE maps the driving audio to three disentangled latent vectors: one for content one for emotion and one for personal style. A latent diffusion model trained to generate gesture motion sequences is then conditioned on these latent vectors. Once trained AMUSE synthesizes 3D human gestures directly from speech with control over the expressed emotions and style by combining the content from the driving speech with the emotion and style of another speech sequence. Randomly sampling the noise of the diffusion model further generates variations of the gesture with the same emotional expressivity. Qualitative quantitative and perceptual evaluations demonstrate that AMUSE outputs realistic gesture sequences. Compared to the state of the art the generated gestures are better synchronized with the speech content and better represent the emotion expressed by the input speech. Our code is available at amuse.is.tue.mpg.de.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chhatre_Emotional_Speech-driven_3D_Body_Animation_via_Disentangled_Latent_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Retrieval-Augmented Layout Transformer for Content-Aware Layout Generation,"Horita, Daichi, Inoue, Naoto, Kikuchi, Kotaro, Yamaguchi, Kota, Aizawa, Kiyoharu",Content-aware graphic layout generation aims to automatically arrange visual elements along with a given content such as an e-commerce product image. In this paper we argue that the current layout generation approaches suffer from the limited training data for the high-dimensional layout structure. We show that a simple retrieval augmentation can significantly improve the generation quality. Our model which is named Retrieval-Augmented Layout Transformer (RALF) retrieves nearest neighbor layout examples based on an input image and feeds these results into an autoregressive generator. Our model can apply retrieval augmentation to various controllable generation tasks and yield high-quality layouts within a unified architecture. Our extensive experiments show that RALF successfully generates content-aware layouts in both constrained and unconstrained settings and significantly outperforms the baselines.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Horita_Retrieval-Augmented_Layout_Transformer_for_Content-Aware_Layout_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
InstantBooth: Personalized Text-to-Image Generation without Test-Time Finetuning,"Shi, Jing, Xiong, Wei, Lin, Zhe, Jung, Hyun Joon",Recent advances in personalized image generation have enabled pre-trained text-to-image models to learn new concepts from specific image sets. However these methods often necessitate extensive test-time finetuning for each new concept leading to inefficiencies in both time and scalability. To address this challenge we introduce InstantBooth an innovative approach leveraging existing text-to-image models for instantaneous text-guided image personalization eliminating the need for test-time finetuning. This efficiency is achieved through two primary innovations. Firstly we utilize an image encoder that transforms input images into a global embedding to grasp the general concept. Secondly we integrate new adapter layers into the pre-trained model enhancing its ability to capture intricate identity details while maintaining language coherence. Significantly our model is trained exclusively on text-image pairs without reliance on concept-specific paired images. When benchmarked against existing finetuning-based personalization techniques like DreamBooth and Textual-Inversion InstantBooth not only shows comparable proficiency in aligning language with image maintaining image quality and preserving identity but also boasts a 100-fold increase in processing speed.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shi_InstantBooth_Personalized_Text-to-Image_Generation_without_Test-Time_Finetuning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SD2Event:Self-supervised Learning of Dynamic Detectors and Contextual Descriptors for Event Cameras,"Gao, Yuan, Zhu, Yuqing, Li, Xinjun, Du, Yimin, Zhang, Tianzhu",Event cameras offer many advantages over traditional frame-based cameras such as high dynamic range and low latency. Therefore event cameras are widely applied in diverse computer vision applications where event-based keypoint detection is a fundamental task. However achieving robust event-based keypoint detection remains challenging because the ground truth of event keypoints is difficult to obtain descriptors extracted by CNN usually lack discriminative ability in the presence of intense noise and fixed keypoint detectors are limited in detecting varied keypoint patterns. To address these challenges a novel event-based keypoint detection method is proposed by learning dynamic detectors and contextual descriptors in a self-supervised manner (SD2Event) including a contextual feature descriptor learning (CFDL) module and a dynamic keypoint detector learning (DKDL) module. The proposed SD2Event enjoys several merits. First the proposed CFDL module can model long-range contexts efficiently and effectively. Second the DKDL module generates dynamic keypoint detectors which can detect keypoints with diverse patterns across various event streams. Third the proposed self-supervised signals can guide the model's adaptation to event data. Extensive experimental results on three challenging benchmarks show that our proposed method significantly outperforms stateof-the-art event-based keypoint detection methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Gao_SD2EventSelf-supervised_Learning_of_Dynamic_Detectors_and_Contextual_Descriptors_for_Event_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PaReNeRF: Toward Fast Large-scale Dynamic NeRF with Patch-based Reference,"Tang, Xiao, Yang, Min, Sun, Penghui, Li, Hui, Dai, Yuchao, Zhu, Feng, Lee, Hojae",With photo-realistic image generation Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is widely used for large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction as autonomous driving simulator. However large-scale scene reconstruction still suffers from extremely long training time and rendering time. Low-resolution (LR) rendering combined with upsampling can alleviate this problem but it degrades image quality. In this paper we design a lightweight reference decoder which exploits prior information from known views to improve image reconstruction quality of new views. In addition to speed up prior information search we propose an optical flow and structural similarity based prior information search method. Results on KITTI and VKITTI2 datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline method in terms of training speed rendering speed and rendering quality.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Tang_PaReNeRF_Toward_Fast_Large-scale_Dynamic_NeRF_with_Patch-based_Reference_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Affine Equivariant Networks Based on Differential Invariants,"Li, Yikang, Qiu, Yeqing, Chen, Yuxuan, He, Lingshen, Lin, Zhouchen",Convolutional neural networks benefit from translation equivariance achieving tremendous success. Equivariant networks further extend this property to other transformation groups. However most existing methods require discretization or sampling of groups leading to increased model sizes for larger groups such as the affine group. In this paper we build affine equivariant networks based on differential invariants from the viewpoint of symmetric PDEs without discretizing or sampling the group. To address the division-by-zero issue arising from fractional differential invariants of the affine group we construct a new kind of affine invariants by normalizing polynomial relative differential invariants to replace classical differential invariants. For further flexibility we design an equivariant layer which can be directly integrated into convolutional networks of various architectures. Moreover our framework for the affine group is also applicable to its continuous subgroups. We implement equivariant networks for the scale group the rotation-scale group and the affine group. Numerical experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our framework across classification tasks involving transformations of these groups. Remarkably under the out-of-distribution setting our model achieves a 3.37% improvement in accuracy over the main counterpart affConv on the affNIST dataset.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_Affine_Equivariant_Networks_Based_on_Differential_Invariants_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Selectively Informative Description can Reduce Undesired Embedding Entanglements in Text-to-Image Personalization,"Kim, Jimyeong, Park, Jungwon, Rhee, Wonjong",In text-to-image personalization a timely and crucial challenge is the tendency of generated images overfitting to the biases present in the reference images. We initiate our study with a comprehensive categorization of the biases into background nearby-object tied-object substance (in style re-contextualization) and pose biases. These biases manifest in the generated images due to their entanglement into the subject embedding. This undesired embedding entanglement not only results in the reflection of biases from the reference images into the generated images but also notably diminishes the alignment of the generated images with the given generation prompt. To address this challenge we propose SID (Selectively Informative Description) a text description strategy that deviates from the prevalent approach of only characterizing the subject's class identification. SID is generated utilizing multimodal GPT-4 and can be seamlessly integrated into optimization-based models. We present comprehensive experimental results along with analyses of cross-attention maps subject-alignment non-subject-disentanglement and text-alignment.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kim_Selectively_Informative_Description_can_Reduce_Undesired_Embedding_Entanglements_in_Text-to-Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Smooth Diffusion: Crafting Smooth Latent Spaces in Diffusion Models,"Guo, Jiayi, Xu, Xingqian, Pu, Yifan, Ni, Zanlin, Wang, Chaofei, Vasu, Manushree, Song, Shiji, Huang, Gao, Shi, Humphrey",Recently diffusion models have made remarkable progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation synthesizing images with high fidelity and diverse contents. Despite this advancement latent space smoothness within diffusion models remains largely unexplored. Smooth latent spaces ensure that a perturbation on an input latent corresponds to a steady change in the output image. This property proves beneficial in downstream tasks including image interpolation inversion and editing. In this work we expose the non-smoothness of diffusion latent spaces by observing noticeable visual fluctuations resulting from minor latent variations. To tackle this issue we propose Smooth Diffusion a new category of diffusion models that can be simultaneously high-performing and smooth. Specifically we introduce Step-wise Variation Regularization to enforce the proportion between the variations of an arbitrary input latent and that of the output image is a constant at any diffusion training step. In addition we devise an interpolation standard deviation (ISTD) metric to effectively assess the latent space smoothness of a diffusion model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion stands out as a more desirable solution not only in T2I generation but also across various downstream tasks. Smooth Diffusion is implemented as a plug-and-play Smooth-LoRA to work with various community models. Code is available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Smooth-Diffusion.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Guo_Smooth_Diffusion_Crafting_Smooth_Latent_Spaces_in_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FlowIE: Efficient Image Enhancement via Rectified Flow,"Zhu, Yixuan, Zhao, Wenliang, Li, Ao, Tang, Yansong, Zhou, Jie, Lu, Jiwen",Image enhancement holds extensive applications in real-world scenarios due to complex environments and limitations of imaging devices. Conventional methods are often constrained by their tailored models resulting in diminished robustness when confronted with challenging degradation conditions. In response we propose FlowIE a simple yet highly effective flow-based image enhancement framework that estimates straight-line paths from an elementary distribution to high-quality images. Unlike previous diffusion-based methods that suffer from long-time inference FlowIE constructs a linear many-to-one transport mapping via conditioned rectified flow. The rectification straightens the trajectories of probability transfer accelerating inference by an order of magnitude. This design enables our FlowIE to fully exploit rich knowledge in the pre-trained diffusion model rendering it well-suited for various real-world applications. Moreover we devise a faster inference algorithm inspired by Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem harnessing midpoint tangent direction to optimize path estimation ultimately yielding visually superior results. Thanks to these designs our FlowIE adeptly manages a diverse range of enhancement tasks within a concise sequence of fewer than 5 steps. Our contributions are rigorously validated through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets unveiling the compelling efficacy and efficiency of our proposed FlowIE.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_FlowIE_Efficient_Image_Enhancement_via_Rectified_Flow_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Improving Training Efficiency of Diffusion Models via Multi-Stage Framework and Tailored Multi-Decoder Architecture,"Zhang, Huijie, Lu, Yifu, Alkhouri, Ismail, Ravishankar, Saiprasad, Song, Dogyoon, Qu, Qing",Diffusion models emerging as powerful deep generative tools excel in various applications. They operate through a two-steps process: introducing noise into training samples and then employing a model to convert random noise into new samples (e.g. images). However their remarkable generative performance is hindered by slow training and sampling. This is due to the necessity of tracking extensive forward and reverse diffusion trajectories and employing a large model with numerous parameters across multiple timesteps (i.e. noise levels). To tackle these challenges we present a multi-stage framework inspired by our empirical findings. These observations indicate the advantages of employing distinct parameters tailored to each timestep while retaining universal parameters shared across all time steps. Our approach involves segmenting the time interval into multiple stages where we employ custom multi-decoder U-net architecture that blends time-dependent models with a universally shared encoder. Our framework enables the efficient distribution of computational resources and mitigates inter-stage interference which substantially improves training efficiency. Extensive numerical experiments affirm the effectiveness of our framework showcasing significant training and sampling efficiency enhancements on three state-of-the-art diffusion models including large-scale latent diffusion models. Furthermore our ablation studies illustrate the impact of two important components in our framework: (i) a novel timestep clustering algorithm for stage division and (ii) an innovative multi-decoder U-net architecture seamlessly integrating universal and customized hyperparameters.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Improving_Training_Efficiency_of_Diffusion_Models_via_Multi-Stage_Framework_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
In-Context Matting,"Guo, He, Ye, Zixuan, Cao, Zhiguo, Lu, Hao",We introduce in-context matting a novel task setting of image matting. Given a reference image of a certain foreground and guided priors such as points scribbles and masks in-context matting enables automatic alpha estimation on a batch of target images of the same foreground category without additional auxiliary input. This setting marries good performance in auxiliary input-based matting and ease of use in automatic matting which finds a good trade-off between customization and automation. To overcome the key challenge of accurate foreground matching we introduce IconMatting an in-context matting model built upon a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Conditioned on inter- and intra-similarity matching IconMatting can make full use of reference context to generate accurate target alpha mattes. To benchmark the task we also introduce a novel testing dataset ICM-57 covering 57 groups of real-world images. Quantitative and qualitative results on the ICM-57 testing set show that IconMatting rivals the accuracy of trimap-based matting while retaining the automation level akin to automatic matting.

DemoCaricature: Democratising Caricature Generation with a Rough Sketch,"Chen, Dar-Yen, Bhunia, Ayan Kumar, Koley, Subhadeep, Sain, Aneeshan, Chowdhury, Pinaki Nath, Song, Yi-Zhe",In this paper we democratise caricature generation empowering individuals to effortlessly craft personalised caricatures with just a photo and a conceptual sketch. Our objective is to strike a delicate balance between abstraction and identity while preserving the creativity and subjectivity inherent in a sketch. To achieve this we present Explicit Rank-1 Model Editing alongside single-image personalisation selectively applying nuanced edits to cross-attention layers for a seamless merge of identity and style. Additionally we propose Random Mask Reconstruction to enhance robustness directing the model to focus on distinctive identity and style features. Crucially our aim is not to replace artists but to eliminate accessibility barriers allowing enthusiasts to engage in the artistry.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_DemoCaricature_Democratising_Caricature_Generation_with_a_Rough_Sketch_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CapHuman: Capture Your Moments in Parallel Universes,"Liang, Chao, Ma, Fan, Zhu, Linchao, Deng, Yingying, Yang, Yi","We concentrate on a novel human-centric image synthesis task that is given only one reference facial photograph it is expected to generate specific individual images with diverse head positions poses facial expressions and illuminations in different contexts. To accomplish this goal we argue that our generative model should be capable of the following favorable characteristics: (1) a strong visual and semantic understanding of our world and human society for basic object and human image generation. (2) generalizable identity preservation ability. (3) flexible and fine-grained head control. Recently large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable results serving as a powerful generative foundation. As a basis we aim to unleash the above two capabilities of the pre-trained model. In this work we present a new framework named CapHuman. We embrace the ""encode then learn to align"" paradigm which enables generalizable identity preservation for new individuals without cumbersome tuning at inference. CapHuman encodes identity features and then learns to align them into the latent space. Moreover we introduce the 3D facial prior to equip our model with control over the human head in a flexible and 3D-consistent manner. Extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate our CapHuman can produce well-identity-preserved photo-realistic and high-fidelity portraits with content-rich representations and various head renditions superior to established baselines.

SDPose: Tokenized Pose Estimation via Circulation-Guide Self-Distillation,"Chen, Sichen, Zhang, Yingyi, Huang, Siming, Yi, Ran, Fan, Ke, Zhang, Ruixin, Chen, Peixian, Wang, Jun, Ding, Shouhong, Ma, Lizhuang",Recently transformer-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art prediction quality on human pose estimation(HPE). Nonetheless most of these top-performing transformer-based models are too computation-consuming and storage-demanding to deploy on edge computing platforms. Those transformer-based models that require fewer resources are prone to under-fitting due to their smaller scale and thus perform notably worse than their larger counterparts. Given this conundrum we introduce SDPose a new self-distillation method for improving the performance of small transformer-based models. To mitigate the problem of under-fitting we design a transformer module named Multi-Cycled Transformer(MCT) based on multiple-cycled forwards to more fully exploit the potential of small model parameters. Further in order to prevent the additional inference compute-consuming brought by MCT we introduce a self-distillation scheme extracting the knowledge from the MCT module to a naive forward model. Specifically on the MSCOCO validation dataset SDPose-T obtains 69.7% mAP with 4.4M parameters and 1.8 GFLOPs. Furthermore SDPose-S-V2 obtains 73.5% mAP on the MSCOCO validation dataset with 6.2M parameters and 4.7 GFLOPs achieving a new state-of-the-art among predominant tiny neural network methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_SDPose_Tokenized_Pose_Estimation_via_Circulation-Guide_Self-Distillation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Authentic Hand Avatar from a Phone Scan via Universal Hand Model,"Moon, Gyeongsik, Xu, Weipeng, Joshi, Rohan, Wu, Chenglei, Shiratori, Takaaki",The authentic 3D hand avatar with every identifiable information such as hand shapes and textures is necessary for immersive experiences in AR/VR. In this paper we present a universal hand model (UHM) which 1) can universally represent high-fidelity 3D hand meshes of arbitrary identities (IDs) and 2) can be adapted to each person with a short phone scan for the authentic hand avatar. For effective universal hand modeling we perform tracking and modeling at the same time while previous 3D hand models perform them separately. The conventional separate pipeline suffers from the accumulated errors from the tracking stage which cannot be recovered in the modeling stage. On the other hand ours does not suffer from the accumulated errors while having a much more concise overall pipeline. We additionally introduce a novel image matching loss function to address a skin sliding during the tracking and modeling while existing works have not focused on it much. Finally using learned priors from our UHM we effectively adapt our UHM to each person's short phone scan for the authentic hand avatar.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Moon_Authentic_Hand_Avatar_from_a_Phone_Scan_via_Universal_Hand_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Open-World Semantic Segmentation Including Class Similarity,"Sodano, Matteo, Magistri, Federico, Nunes, Lucas, Behley, Jens, Stachniss, Cyrill",Interpreting camera data is key for autonomously acting systems such as autonomous vehicles. Vision systems that operate in real-world environments must be able to understand their surroundings and need the ability to deal with novel situations. This paper tackles open-world semantic segmentation i.e. the variant of interpreting image data in which objects occur that have not been seen during training. We propose a novel approach that performs accurate closed-world semantic segmentation and at the same time can identify new categories without requiring any additional training data. Our approach additionally provides a similarity measure for every newly discovered class in an image to a known category which can be useful information in downstream tasks such as planning or mapping. Through extensive experiments we show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on classes known from training data as well as for anomaly segmentation and can distinguish between different unknown classes.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sodano_Open-World_Semantic_Segmentation_Including_Class_Similarity_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Towards Memorization-Free Diffusion Models,"Chen, Chen, Liu, Daochang, Xu, Chang",Pretrained diffusion models and their outputs are widely accessible due to their exceptional capacity for synthesizing high-quality images and their open-source nature. The users however may face litigation risks owing to the models' tendency to memorize and regurgitate training data during inference. To address this we introduce Anti-Memorization Guidance (AMG) a novel framework employing three targeted guidance strategies for the main causes of memorization: image and caption duplication and highly specific user prompts. Consequently AMG ensures memorization-free outputs while maintaining high image quality and text alignment leveraging the synergy of its guidance methods each indispensable in its own right. AMG also features an innovative automatic detection system for potential memorization during each step of inference process allows selective application of guidance strategies minimally interfering with the original sampling process to preserve output utility. We applied AMG to pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Stable Diffusion across various generation tasks. The results demonstrate that AMG is the first approach to successfully eradicates all instances of memorization with no or marginal impacts on image quality and text-alignment as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Towards_Memorization-Free_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
IQ-VFI: Implicit Quadratic Motion Estimation for Video Frame Interpolation,"Hu, Mengshun, Jiang, Kui, Zhong, Zhihang, Wang, Zheng, Zheng, Yinqiang",Advanced video frame interpolation (VFI) algorithms approximate intermediate motions between two input frames to synthesize intermediate frame. However they struggle to handle complex scenarios with curvilinear motions since they overlook the latent acceleration information between the input frames. Moreover the supervision of predicted motions is tricky because ground-truth motions are not available. To this end we propose a novel framework for implicit quadratic video frame interpolation (IQ-VFI) which explores latent acceleration information and accurate intermediate motions via knowledge distillation. Specifically the proposed IQ-VFI consists of an implicit acceleration estimation network (IANet) and a VFI backbone the former fully leverages spatio-temporal information to explore latent acceleration priors between two input frames which is then used to progressively modulate linear motions from the latter into quadratic motions in coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore to encourage both components to distill more acceleration and motion cues oriented towards VFI we propose a knowledge distillation strategy in which implicit acceleration distillation loss and implicit motion distillation loss are employed to adaptively guide latent acceleration priors and intermediate motions learning respectively. Extensive experiments show that our proposed IQ-VFI can achieve state-of-the-art performances on various benchmark datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hu_IQ-VFI_Implicit_Quadratic_Motion_Estimation_for_Video_Frame_Interpolation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
KeyPoint Relative Position Encoding for Face Recognition,"Kim, Minchul, Su, Yiyang, Liu, Feng, Jain, Anil, Liu, Xiaoming",In this paper we address the challenge of making ViT models more robust to unseen affine transformations. Such robustness becomes useful in various recognition tasks such as face recognition when image alignment failures occur. We propose a novel method called KP-RPE which leverages key points (e.g.facial landmarks) to make ViT more resilient to scale translation and pose variations. We begin with the observation that Relative Position Encoding (RPE) is a good way to bring affine transform generalization to ViTs. RPE however can only inject the model with prior knowledge that nearby pixels are more important than far pixels. Keypoint RPE (KP-RPE) is an extension of this principle where the significance of pixels is not solely dictated by their proximity but also by their relative positions to specific keypoints within the image. By anchoring the significance of pixels around keypoints the model can more effectively retain spatial relationships even when those relationships are disrupted by affine transformations. We show the merit of KP-RPE in face and gait recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness in improving face recognition performance from low-quality images particularly where alignment is prone to failure. Code and pre-trained models are available.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kim_KeyPoint_Relative_Position_Encoding_for_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Hyper-MD: Mesh Denoising with Customized Parameters Aware of Noise Intensity and Geometric Characteristics,"Wang, Xingtao, Wei, Hongliang, Fan, Xiaopeng, Zhao, Debin",Mesh denoising (MD) is a critical task in geometry processing as meshes from scanning or AIGC techniques are susceptible to noise contamination. The challenge of MD lies in the diverse nature of mesh facets in terms of geometric characteristics and noise distributions. Despite recent advancements in deep learning-based MD methods existing MD networks typically neglect the consideration of geometric characteristics and noise distributions. In this paper we propose Hyper-MD a hyper-network-based approach that addresses this limitation by dynamically customizing denoising parameters for each facet based on its noise intensity and geometric characteristics. Specifically Hyper-MD is composed of a hyper-network and an MD network. For each noisy facet the hyper-network takes two angles as input to customize parameters for the MD network. These two angles are specially defined to reveal the noise intensity and geometric characteristics of the current facet respectively. The MD network receives a facet patch as input and outputs the denoised normal using the customized parameters. Experimental results on synthetic and real-scanned meshes demonstrate that Hyper-MD outperforms state-of-the-art mesh denoising methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Hyper-MD_Mesh_Denoising_with_Customized_Parameters_Aware_of_Noise_Intensity_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Beyond First-Order Tweedie: Solving Inverse Problems using Latent Diffusion,"Rout, Litu, Chen, Yujia, Kumar, Abhishek, Caramanis, Constantine, Shakkottai, Sanjay, Chu, Wen-Sheng",Sampling from the posterior distribution in latent diffusion models for inverse problems is computationally challenging. Existing methods often rely on Tweedie's first-order moments that tend to induce biased results. Second-order approximations are computationally prohibitive making standard reverse diffusion processes intractable for posterior sampling. This paper presents Second-order Tweedie sampler from Surrogate Loss (STSL) a novel sampler offering efficiency comparable to first-order Tweedie while enabling tractable reverse processes using second-order approximation. Theoretical results reveal that our approach utilizing for the trace of the Hessian with only O(1) compute establishes a lower bound through a surrogate loss and enables a tractable reverse process. We show STSL outperforms SoTA solvers PSLD and P2L by reducing neural function evaluations by 4X and 8X respectively while enhancing sampling quality on FFHQ ImageNet and COCO benchmarks. Moreover STSL extends to text guided image editing and mitigates residual distortions in corrupted images. To our best knowledge this is the first work to offer an efficient second order approximation for solving inverse problems using latent diffusion and editing real world images with corruptions.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Rout_Beyond_First-Order_Tweedie_Solving_Inverse_Problems_using_Latent_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Rethinking the Objectives of Vector-Quantized Tokenizers for Image Synthesis,"Gu, Yuchao, Wang, Xintao, Ge, Yixiao, Shan, Ying, Shou, Mike Zheng",Vector-Quantized (VQ-based) generative models usually consist of two basic components i.e. VQ tokenizers and generative transformers. Prior research focuses on improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers but rarely examines how the improvement in reconstruction affects the generation ability of generative transformers. In this paper we find that improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers does not necessarily improve the generation. Instead learning to compress semantic features within VQ tokenizers significantly improves generative transformers' ability to capture textures and structures. We thus highlight two competing objectives of VQ tokenizers for image synthesis: semantic compression and details preservation. Different from previous work that prioritizes better details preservation we propose Semantic-Quantized GAN (SeQ-GAN) with two learning phases to balance the two objectives. In the first phase we propose a semantic-enhanced perceptual loss for better semantic compression. In the second phase we fix the encoder and codebook but finetune the decoder to achieve better details preservation. Our proposed SeQ-GAN significantly improves VQ-based generative models for both unconditional and conditional image generation. Specifically SeQ-GAN achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 6.25 and Inception Score (IS) of 140.9 on 256x256 ImageNet generation a remarkable improvement over VIT-VQGAN which obtains 11.2 FID and 97.2 IS.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Gu_Rethinking_the_Objectives_of_Vector-Quantized_Tokenizers_for_Image_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Continuous Pose for Monocular Cameras in Neural Implicit Representation,"Ma, Qi, Paudel, Danda Pani, Chhatkuli, Ajad, Van Gool, Luc",In this paper we showcase the effectiveness of optimizing monocular camera poses as a continuous function of time. The camera poses are represented using an implicit neural function which maps the given time to the corresponding camera pose. The mapped camera poses are then used for the downstream tasks where joint camera pose optimization is also required. While doing so the network parameters - that implicitly represent camera poses - are optimized. We exploit the proposed method in four diverse experimental settings namely (1) NeRF from noisy poses; (2) NeRF from asynchronous Events; (3) Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM); and (4) vSLAM with IMUs. In all four settings the proposed method performs significantly better than the compared baselines and the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally using the assumption of continuous motion changes in pose may actually live in a manifold that has lower than 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) is also realized. We call this low DOF motion representation as the intrinsic motion and use the approach in vSLAM settings show ing impressive camera tracking performance.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ma_Continuous_Pose_for_Monocular_Cameras_in_Neural_Implicit_Representation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
D^4: Dataset Distillation via Disentangled Diffusion Model,"Su, Duo, Hou, Junjie, Gao, Weizhi, Tian, Yingjie, Tang, Bowen",Dataset distillation offers a lightweight synthetic dataset for fast network training with promising test accuracy. To imitate the performance of the original dataset most approaches employ bi-level optimization and the distillation space relies on the matching architecture. Nevertheless these approaches either suffer significant computational costs on large-scale datasets or experience performance decline on cross-architectures. We advocate for designing an economical dataset distillation framework that is independent of the matching architectures.With empirical observations we argue that constraining the consistency of the real and synthetic image spaces will enhance the cross-architecture generalization. Motivated by this we introduce Dataset Distillation via Disentangled Diffusion Model (D^4M) an efficient framework for dataset distillation. Compared to architecture-dependent methods D^4M employs latent diffusion model to guarantee consistency and incorporates label information into category prototypes. The distilled datasets are versatile eliminating the need for repeated generation of distinct datasets for various architectures. Through comprehensive experiments D^4M demonstrates superior performance and robust generalization surpassing the SOTA methods across most aspects.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Su_D4_Dataset_Distillation_via_Disentangled_Diffusion_Model_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
360DVD: Controllable Panorama Video Generation with 360-Degree Video Diffusion Model,"Wang, Qian, Li, Weiqi, Mou, Chong, Cheng, Xinhua, Zhang, Jian",Panorama video recently attracts more interest in both study and application courtesy of its immersive experience. Due to the expensive cost of capturing 360-degree panoramic videos generating desirable panorama videos by prompts is urgently required. Lately the emerging text-to-video (T2V) diffusion methods demonstrate notable effectiveness in standard video generation. However due to the significant gap in content and motion patterns between panoramic and standard videos these methods encounter challenges in yielding satisfactory 360-degree panoramic videos. In this paper we propose a pipeline named 360-Degree Video Diffusion model (360DVD) for generating 360-degree panoramic videos based on the given prompts and motion conditions. Specifically we introduce a lightweight 360-Adapter accompanied by 360 Enhancement Techniques to transform pre-trained T2V models for panorama video generation. We further propose a new panorama dataset named WEB360 consisting of panoramic video-text pairs for training 360DVD addressing the absence of captioned panoramic video datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of 360DVD for panorama video generation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_360DVD_Controllable_Panorama_Video_Generation_with_360-Degree_Video_Diffusion_Model_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
RankMatch: Exploring the Better Consistency Regularization for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Mai, Huayu, Sun, Rui, Zhang, Tianzhu, Wu, Feng",The key lie in semi-supervised semantic segmentation is how to fully exploit substantial unlabeled data to improve the model's generalization performance by resorting to constructing effective supervision signals. Most methods tend to directly apply contrastive learning to seek additional supervision to complement independent regular pixel-wise consistency regularization. However these methods tend not to be preferred ascribed to their complicated designs heavy memory footprints and susceptibility to confirmation bias. In this paper we analyze the bottlenecks exist in contrastive learning-based methods and offer a fresh perspective on inter-pixel correlations to construct more safe and effective supervision signals which is in line with the nature of semantic segmentation. To this end we develop a coherent RankMatch network including the construction of representative agents to model inter-pixel correlation beyond regular individual pixel-wise consistency and further unlock the potential of agents by modeling inter-agent relationships in pursuit of rank-aware correlation consistency. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks including mitochondria segmentation demonstrate that RankMatch performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. Particularly in the low-data regimes RankMatch achieves significant improvements.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mai_RankMatch_Exploring_the_Better_Consistency_Regularization_for_Semi-supervised_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DuPL: Dual Student with Trustworthy Progressive Learning for Robust Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Wu, Yuanchen, Ye, Xichen, Yang, Kequan, Li, Jide, Li, Xiaoqiang",Recently One-stage Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has gained increasing interest due to simplification over its cumbersome multi-stage counterpart. Limited by the inherent ambiguity of Class Activation Map (CAM) we observe that one-stage pipelines often encounter confirmation bias caused by incorrect CAM pseudo-labels impairing their final segmentation performance. Although recent works discard many unreliable pseudo-labels to implicitly alleviate this issue they fail to exploit sufficient supervision for their models. To this end we propose a dual student framework with trustworthy progressive learning (DuPL). Specifically we propose a dual student network with a discrepancy loss to yield diverse CAMs for each sub-net. The two sub-nets generate supervision for each other mitigating the confirmation bias caused by learning their own incorrect pseudo-labels. In this process we progressively introduce more trustworthy pseudo-labels to be involved in the supervision through dynamic threshold adjustment with an adaptive noise filtering strategy. Moreover we believe that every pixel even discarded from supervision due to its unreliability is important for WSSS. Thus we develop consistency regularization on these discarded regions providing supervision of every pixel. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DuPL over the recent state-of-the-art alternatives on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/Wu0409/DuPL.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wu_DuPL_Dual_Student_with_Trustworthy_Progressive_Learning_for_Robust_Weakly_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SurMo: Surface-based 4D Motion Modeling for Dynamic Human Rendering,"Hu, Tao, Hong, Fangzhou, Liu, Ziwei",Dynamic human rendering from video sequences has achieved remarkable progress by formulating the rendering as a mapping from static poses to human images. However existing methods focus on the human appearance reconstruction of every single frame while the temporal motion relations are not fully explored. In this paper we propose a new 4D motion modeling paradigm SurMo that jointly models the temporal dynamics and human appearances in a unified framework with three key designs: 1) Surface-based motion encoding that models 4D human motions with an efficient compact surface-based triplane. It encodes both spatial and temporal motion relations on the dense surface manifold of a statistical body template which inherits body topology priors for generalizable novel view synthesis with sparse training observations. 2) Physical motion decoding that is designed to encourage physical motion learning by decoding the motion triplane features at timestep t to predict both spatial derivatives and temporal derivatives at the next timestep t+1 in the training stage. 3) 4D appearance decoding that renders the motion triplanes into images by an efficient volumetric surface-conditioned renderer that focuses on the rendering of body surfaces with motion learning conditioning. Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of our new paradigm and illustrate the expressiveness of surface-based motion triplanes for rendering high-fidelity view-consistent humans with fast motions and even motion-dependent shadows.

Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Decoupling for Text-to-Video Generation,"Qing, Zhiwu, Zhang, Shiwei, Wang, Jiayu, Wang, Xiang, Wei, Yujie, Zhang, Yingya, Gao, Changxin, Sang, Nong",Despite diffusion models having shown powerful abilities to generate photorealistic images generating videos that are realistic and diverse still remains in its infancy. One of the key reasons is that current methods intertwine spatial content and temporal dynamics together leading to a notably increased complexity of text-to-video generation (T2V). In this work we propose HiGen a diffusion model-based method that improves performance by decoupling the spatial and temporal factors of videos from two perspectives i.e. structure level and content level. At the structure level we decompose the T2V task into two steps including spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning using a unified denoiser. Specifically we generate spatially coherent priors using text during spatial reasoning and then generate temporally coherent motions from these priors during temporal reasoning. At the content level we extract two subtle cues from the content of the input video that can express motion and appearance changes respectively. These two cues then guide the model's training for generating videos enabling flexible content variations and enhancing temporal stability. Through the decoupled paradigm HiGen can effectively reduce the complexity of this task and generate realistic videos with semantics accuracy and motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of HiGen over the state-of-the-art T2V methods. We have released our source code and models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Qing_Hierarchical_Spatio-temporal_Decoupling_for_Text-to-Video_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PLACE: Adaptive Layout-Semantic Fusion for Semantic Image Synthesis,"Lv, Zhengyao, Wei, Yuxiang, Zuo, Wangmeng, Wong, Kwan-Yee K.",Recent advancements in large-scale pre-trained text-to-image models have led to remarkable progress in semantic image synthesis. Nevertheless synthesizing high-quality images with consistent semantics and layout remains a challenge. In this paper we propose the adaPtive LAyout-semantiC fusion modulE (PLACE) that harnesses pre-trained models to alleviate the aforementioned issues. Specifically we first employ the layout control map to faithfully represent layouts in the feature space. Subsequently we combine the layout and semantic features in a timestep-adaptive manner to synthesize images with realistic details. During fine-tuning we propose the Semantic Alignment (SA) loss to further enhance layout alignment. Additionally we introduce the Layout-Free Prior Preservation (LFP) loss which leverages unlabeled data to maintain the priors of pre-trained models thereby improving the visual quality and semantic consistency of synthesized images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs favorably in terms of visual quality semantic consistency and layout alignment. The source code and model are available at \href https://github.com/cszy98/PLACE/tree/main  PLACE .,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lv_PLACE_Adaptive_Layout-Semantic_Fusion_for_Semantic_Image_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Exploring Efficient Asymmetric Blind-Spots for Self-Supervised Denoising in Real-World Scenarios,"Chen, Shiyan, Zhang, Jiyuan, Yu, Zhaofei, Huang, Tiejun",Self-supervised denoising has attracted widespread attention due to its ability to train without clean images. However noise in real-world scenarios is often spatially correlated which causes many self-supervised algorithms that assume pixel-wise independent noise to perform poorly. Recent works have attempted to break noise correlation with downsampling or neighborhood masking. However denoising on downsampled subgraphs can lead to aliasing effects and loss of details due to a lower sampling rate. Furthermore the neighborhood masking methods either come with high computational complexity or do not consider local spatial preservation during inference. Through the analysis of existing methods we point out that the key to obtaining high-quality and texture-rich results in real-world self-supervised denoising tasks is to train at the original input resolution structure and use asymmetric operations during training and inference. Based on this we propose Asymmetric Tunable Blind-Spot Network (AT-BSN) where the blind-spot size can be freely adjusted thus better balancing noise correlation suppression and image local spatial destruction during training and inference. In addition we regard the pre-trained AT-BSN as a meta-teacher network capable of generating various teacher networks by sampling different blind-spots. We propose a blind-spot based multi-teacher distillation strategy to distill a lightweight network significantly improving performance. Experimental results on multiple datasets prove that our method achieves state-of-the-art and is superior to other self-supervised algorithms in terms of computational overhead and visual effects.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Exploring_Efficient_Asymmetric_Blind-Spots_for_Self-Supervised_Denoising_in_Real-World_Scenarios_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Efficient Multi-scale Network with Learnable Discrete Wavelet Transform for Blind Motion Deblurring,"Gao, Xin, Qiu, Tianheng, Zhang, Xinyu, Bai, Hanlin, Liu, Kang, Huang, Xuan, Wei, Hu, Zhang, Guoying, Liu, Huaping",Coarse-to-fine schemes are widely used in traditional single-image motion deblur; however in the context of deep learning existing multi-scale algorithms not only require the use of complex modules for feature fusion of low-scale RGB images and deep semantics but also manually generate low-resolution pairs of images that do not have sufficient confidence. In this work we propose a multi-scale network based on single-input and multiple-outputs(SIMO) for motion deblurring. This simplifies the complexity of algorithms based on a coarse-to-fine scheme. To alleviate restoration defects impacting detail information brought about by using a multi-scale architecture we combine the characteristics of real-world blurring trajectories with a learnable wavelet transform module to focus on the directional continuity and frequency features of the step-by-step transitions between blurred images to sharp images. In conclusion we propose a multi-scale network with a learnable discrete wavelet transform (MLWNet) which exhibits state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world deblurred datasets in terms of both subjective and objective quality as well as computational efficiency.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Gao_Efficient_Multi-scale_Network_with_Learnable_Discrete_Wavelet_Transform_for_Blind_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MaskPLAN: Masked Generative Layout Planning from Partial Input,"Zhang, Hang, Savov, Anton, Dillenburger, Benjamin","Layout planning spanning from architecture to interior design is a slow iterative exploration of ill-defined problems adopting a ""I'll know it when I see it"" approach to potential solutions. Recent advances in generative models promise automating layout generation yet often overlook the crucial role of user-guided iteration cannot generate full solutions from incomplete design ideas and do not learn for the inter-dependency of layout attributes. To address these limitations we propose MaskPLAN a novel generative model based on Graph-structured Dynamic Masked Autoencoders (GDMAE) featuring five transformers generating a blend of graph-based and image-based layout attributes. MaskPLAN lets users generate and adjust layouts with partial attribute definitions create alternatives for preferences and practice new composition-driven or functionality-driven workflows. Through cross-attribute learning and the user input as a global conditional prior we ensure that design synthesis is calibrated at every intermediate stage maintaining its feasibility and practicality. Extensive evaluations show MaskPLAN's superior performance over existing methods across multiple metrics.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_MaskPLAN_Masked_Generative_Layout_Planning_from_Partial_Input_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HMD-Poser: On-Device Real-time Human Motion Tracking from Scalable Sparse Observations,"Dai, Peng, Zhang, Yang, Liu, Tao, Fan, Zhen, Du, Tianyuan, Su, Zhuo, Zheng, Xiaozheng, Li, Zeming",It is especially challenging to achieve real-time human motion tracking on a standalone VR Head-Mounted Display (HMD) such as Meta Quest and PICO. In this paper we propose HMD-Poser the first unified approach to recover full-body motions using scalable sparse observations from HMD and body-worn IMUs. In particular it can support a variety of input scenarios such as HMD HMD+2IMUs HMD+3IMUs etc. The scalability of inputs may accommodate users' choices for both high tracking accuracy and easy-to-wear. A lightweight temporal-spatial feature learning network is proposed in HMD-Poser to guarantee that the model runs in real-time on HMDs. Furthermore HMD-Poser presents online body shape estimation to improve the position accuracy of body joints. Extensive experimental results on the challenging AMASS dataset show that HMD-Poser achieves new state-of-the-art results in both accuracy and real-time performance. We also build a new free-dancing motion dataset to evaluate HMD-Poser's on-device performance and investigate the performance gap between synthetic data and real-captured sensor data. Finally we demonstrate our HMD-Poser with a real-time Avatar-driving application on a commercial HMD.

Flexible Biometrics Recognition: Bridging the Multimodality Gap through Attention Alignment and Prompt Tuning,"Tiong, Leslie Ching Ow, Sigmund, Dick, Chan, Chen-Hui, Teoh, Andrew Beng Jin",Periocular and face are complementary biometrics for identity management albeit with inherent limitations notably in scenarios involving occlusion due to sunglasses or masks. In response to these challenges we introduce Flexible Biometric Recognition (FBR) a novel framework designed to advance conventional face periocular and multimodal face-periocular biometrics across both intra- and cross-modality recognition tasks. FBR strategically utilizes the Multimodal Fusion Attention (MFA) and Multimodal Prompt Tuning (MPT) mechanisms within the Vision Transformer architecture. MFA facilitates the fusion of modalities ensuring cohesive alignment between facial and periocular embeddings while incorporating soft-biometrics to enhance the model's ability to discriminate between individuals. The fusion of three modalities is pivotal in exploring interrelationships between different modalities. Additionally MPT serves as a unifying bridge intertwining inputs and promoting cross-modality interactions while preserving their distinctive characteristics. The collaborative synergy of MFA and MPT enhances the shared features of the face and periocular with a specific emphasis on the ocular region yielding exceptional performance in both intra- and cross-modality recognition tasks. Rigorous experimentation across four benchmark datasets validates the noteworthy performance of the FBR model.

Multi-scale Dynamic and Hierarchical Relationship Modeling for Facial Action Units Recognition,"Wang, Zihan, Song, Siyang, Luo, Cheng, Deng, Songhe, Xie, Weicheng, Shen, Linlin",Human facial action units (AUs) are mutually related in a hierarchical manner as not only they are associated with each other in both spatial and temporal domains but also AUs located in the same/close facial regions show stronger relationships than those of different facial regions. While none of existing approach thoroughly model such hierarchical inter-dependencies among AUs this paper proposes to comprehensively model multi-scale AU-related dynamic and hierarchical spatio-temporal relationship among AUs for their occurrences recognition. Specifically we first propose a novel multi-scale temporal differencing network with an adaptive weighting block to explicitly capture facial dynamics across frames at different spatial scales which specifically considers the heterogeneity of range and magnitude in different AUs' activation. Then a two-stage strategy is introduced to hierarchically model the relationship among AUs based on their spatial distribution (i.e. local and cross-region AU relationship modelling). Experimental results achieved on BP4D and DISFA show that our approach is the new state-of-the-art in the field of AU occurrence recognition.

EventEgo3D: 3D Human Motion Capture from Egocentric Event Streams,"Millerdurai, Christen, Akada, Hiroyasu, Wang, Jian, Luvizon, Diogo, Theobalt, Christian, Golyanik, Vladislav",Monocular egocentric 3D human motion capture is a challenging and actively researched problem. Existing methods use synchronously operating visual sensors (e.g. RGB cameras) and often fail under low lighting and fast motions which can be restricting in many applications involving head-mounted devices. In response to the existing limitations this paper 1) introduces a new problem i.e. 3D human motion capture from an egocentric monocular event camera with a fisheye lens and 2) proposes the first approach to it called EventEgo3D (EE3D). Event streams have high temporal resolution and provide reliable cues for 3D human motion capture under high-speed human motions and rapidly changing illumination. The proposed EE3D framework is specifically tailored for learning with event streams in the LNES representation enabling high 3D reconstruction accuracy. We also design a prototype of a mobile head-mounted device with an event camera and record a real dataset with event observations and the ground-truth 3D human poses (in addition to the synthetic dataset). Our EE3D demonstrates robustness and superior 3D accuracy compared to existing solutions across various challenging experiments while supporting real-time 3D pose update rates of 140Hz.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Millerdurai_EventEgo3D_3D_Human_Motion_Capture_from_Egocentric_Event_Streams_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
A Call to Reflect on Evaluation Practices for Age Estimation: Comparative Analysis of the State-of-the-Art and a Unified Benchmark,"Paplh√°m, Jakub, Franc, Vojt?ch",Comparing different age estimation methods poses a challenge due to the unreliability of published results stemming from inconsistencies in the benchmarking process. Previous studies have reported continuous performance improvements over the past decade using specialized methods; however our findings challenge these claims. This paper identifies two trivial yet persistent issues with the currently used evaluation protocol and describes how to resolve them. We offer an extensive comparative analysis for state-of-the-art facial age estimation methods. Surprisingly we find that the performance differences between the methods are negligible compared to the effect of other factors such as facial alignment facial coverage image resolution model architecture or the amount of data used for pretraining. We use the gained insights to propose using FaRL as the backbone model and demonstrate its effectiveness on all public datasets.

CosalPure: Learning Concept from Group Images for Robust Co-Saliency Detection,"Zhu, Jiayi, Guo, Qing, Juefei-Xu, Felix, Huang, Yihao, Liu, Yang, Pu, Geguang",Co-salient object detection (CoSOD) aims to identify the common and salient (usually in the foreground) regions across a given group of images. Although achieving significant progress state-of-the-art CoSODs could be easily affected by some adversarial perturbations leading to substantial accuracy reduction. The adversarial perturbations can mislead CoSODs but do not change the high-level semantic information (e.g. concept) of the co-salient objects. In this paper we propose a novel robustness enhancement framework by first learning the concept of the co-salient objects based on the input group images and then leveraging this concept to purify adversarial perturbations which are subsequently fed to CoSODs for robustness enhancement. Specifically we propose CosalPure containing two modules i.e. group-image concept learning and concept-guided diffusion purification. For the first module we adopt a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to learn the concept of co-salient objects within group images where the learned concept is robust to adversarial examples. For the second module we map the adversarial image to the latent space and then perform diffusion generation by embedding the learned concept into the noise prediction function as an extra condition. Our method can effectively alleviate the influence of the SOTA adversarial attack containing different adversarial patterns including exposure and noise. The extensive results demonstrate that our method could enhance the robustness of CoSODs significantly.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_CosalPure_Learning_Concept_from_Group_Images_for_Robust_Co-Saliency_Detection_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MRFP: Learning Generalizable Semantic Segmentation from Sim-2-Real with Multi-Resolution Feature Perturbation,"Udupa, Sumanth, Gurunath, Prajwal, Sikdar, Aniruddh, Sundaram, Suresh",Deep neural networks have shown exemplary performance on semantic scene understanding tasks on source domains but due to the absence of style diversity during training enhancing performance on unseen target domains using only single source domain data remains a challenging task. Generation of simulated data is a feasible alternative to retrieving large style-diverse real-world datasets as it is a cumbersome and budget-intensive process. However the large domain-specific inconsistencies between simulated and real-world data pose a significant generalization challenge in semantic segmentation. In this work to alleviate this problem we propose a novel Multi-Resolution Feature Perturbation (MRFP) technique to randomize domain-specific fine-grained features and perturb style of coarse features. Our experimental results on various urban-scene segmentation datasets clearly indicate that along with the perturbation of style-information perturbation of fine-feature components is paramount to learn domain invariant robust feature maps for semantic segmentation models. MRFP is a simple and computationally efficient transferable module with no additional learnable parameters or objective functions that helps state-of-the-art deep neural networks to learn robust domain invariant features for simulation-to-real semantic segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/airl-iisc/MRFP.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Udupa_MRFP_Learning_Generalizable_Semantic_Segmentation_from_Sim-2-Real_with_Multi-Resolution_Feature_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MotionEditor: Editing Video Motion via Content-Aware Diffusion,"Tu, Shuyuan, Dai, Qi, Cheng, Zhi-Qi, Hu, Han, Han, Xintong, Wu, Zuxuan, Jiang, Yu-Gang",Existing diffusion-based video editing models have made gorgeous advances for editing attributes of a source video over time but struggle to manipulate the motion information while preserving the original protagonist's appearance and background. To address this we propose MotionEditor the first diffusion model for video motion editing. MotionEditor incorporates a novel content-aware motion adapter into ControlNet to capture temporal motion correspondence. While ControlNet enables direct generation based on skeleton poses it encounters challenges when modifying the source motion in the inverted noise due to contradictory signals between the noise (source) and the condition (reference). Our adapter complements ControlNet by involving source content to transfer adapted control signals seamlessly. Further we build up a two-branch architecture (a reconstruction branch and an editing branch) with a high-fidelity attention injection mechanism facilitating branch interaction. This mechanism enables the editing branch to query the key and value from the reconstruction branch in a decoupled manner making the editing branch retain the original background and protagonist appearance. We also propose a skeleton alignment algorithm to address the discrepancies in pose size and position. Experiments demonstrate the promising motion editing ability of MotionEditor both qualitatively and quantitatively. To the best of our knowledge MotionEditor is the first to use diffusion models specifically for video motion editing considering the origin dynamic background and camera movement.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Tu_MotionEditor_Editing_Video_Motion_via_Content-Aware_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Doubly Abductive Counterfactual Inference for Text-based Image Editing,"Song, Xue, Cui, Jiequan, Zhang, Hanwang, Chen, Jingjing, Hong, Richang, Jiang, Yu-Gang",We study text-based image editing (TBIE) of a single image by counterfactual inference because it is an elegant formulation to precisely address the requirement: the edited image should retain the fidelity of the original one. Through the lens of the formulation we find that the crux of TBIE is that existing techniques hardly achieve a good trade-off between editability and fidelity mainly due to the overfitting of the single-image fine-tuning. To this end we propose a Doubly Abductive Counterfactual inference framework (DAC). We first parameterize an exogenous variable as a UNet LoRA whose abduction can encode all the image details. Second we abduct another exogenous variable parameterized by a text encoder LoRA which recovers the lost editability caused by the overfitted first abduction. Thanks to the second abduction which exclusively encodes the visual transition from post-edit to pre-edit its inversion---subtracting the LoRA---effectively reverts pre-edit back to post-edit thereby accomplishing the edit. Through extensive experiments our DAC achieves a good trade-off between editability and fidelity. Thus we can support a wide spectrum of user editing intents including addition removal manipulation replacement style transfer and facial change which are extensively validated in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Codes are in https://github.com/xuesong39/DAC.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Song_Doubly_Abductive_Counterfactual_Inference_for_Text-based_Image_Editing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Normalizing Flows on the Product Space of SO(3) Manifolds for Probabilistic Human Pose Modeling,"D√ºnkel, Olaf, Salzmann, Tim, Pfaff, Florian",Normalizing flows have proven their efficacy for density estimation in Euclidean space but their application to rotational representations crucial in various domains such as robotics or human pose modeling remains underexplored. Probabilistic models of the human pose can benefit from approaches that rigorously consider the rotational nature of human joints. For this purpose we introduce HuProSO3 a normalizing flow model that operates on a high-dimensional product space of SO(3) manifolds modeling the joint distribution for human joints with three degrees of freedom. HuProSO3's advantage over state-of-the-art approaches is demonstrated through its superior modeling accuracy in three different applications and its capability to evaluate the exact likelihood. This work not only addresses the technical challenge of learning densities on SO(3) manifolds but it also has broader implications for domains where the probabilistic regression of correlated 3D rotations is of importance. Code will be available at https://github.com/odunkel/HuProSO.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Dunkel_Normalizing_Flows_on_the_Product_Space_of_SO3_Manifolds_for_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ReGenNet: Towards Human Action-Reaction Synthesis,"Xu, Liang, Zhou, Yizhou, Yan, Yichao, Jin, Xin, Zhu, Wenhan, Rao, Fengyun, Yang, Xiaokang, Zeng, Wenjun",Humans constantly interact with their surrounding environments. Current human-centric generative models mainly focus on synthesizing humans plausibly interacting with static scenes and objects while the dynamic human action-reaction synthesis for ubiquitous causal human-human interactions is less explored. Human-human interactions can be regarded as asymmetric with actors and reactors in atomic interaction periods. In this paper we comprehensively analyze the asymmetric dynamic synchronous and detailed nature of human-human interactions and propose the first multi-setting human action-reaction synthesis benchmark to generate human reactions conditioned on given human actions. To begin with we propose to annotate the actor-reactor order of the interaction sequences for the NTU120 InterHuman and Chi3D datasets. Based on them a diffusion-based generative model with a Transformer decoder architecture called ReGenNet together with an explicit distance-based interaction loss is proposed to predict human reactions in an online manner where the future states of actors are unavailable to reactors. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method can generate instant and plausible human reactions compared to the baselines and can generalize to unseen actor motions and viewpoint changes.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_ReGenNet_Towards_Human_Action-Reaction_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
A Simple Baseline for Efficient Hand Mesh Reconstruction,"Zhou, Zhishan, Zhou, Shihao, Lv, Zhi, Zou, Minqiang, Tang, Yao, Liang, Jiajun",Hand mesh reconstruction has attracted considerable attention in recent years with various approaches and techniques being proposed. Some of these methods incorporate complex components and designs which while effective may complicate the model and hinder efficiency. In this paper we decompose the mesh decoder into token generator and mesh regressor. Through extensive ablation experiments we found that the token generator should select discriminating and representative points while the mesh regressor needs to upsample sparse keypoints into dense meshes in multiple stages. Given these functionalities we can achieve high performance with minimal computational resources. Based on this observation we propose a simple yet effective baseline that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while maintaining real-time efficiency. Our method outperforms existing solutions achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across multiple datasets. On the FreiHAND dataset our approach produced a PA-MPJPE of 5.8mm and a PA-MPVPE of 6.1mm. Similarly on the DexYCB dataset we observed a PA-MPJPE of 5.5mm and a PA-MPVPE of 5.5mm. As for performance speed our method reached up to 33 frames per second (fps) when using HRNet and up to 70 fps when employing FastViT-MA36. Code will be made available.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_A_Simple_Baseline_for_Efficient_Hand_Mesh_Reconstruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PhotoMaker: Customizing Realistic Human Photos via Stacked ID Embedding,"Li, Zhen, Cao, Mingdeng, Wang, Xintao, Qi, Zhongang, Cheng, Ming-Ming, Shan, Ying",Recent advances in text-to-image generation have made remarkable progress in synthesizing realistic human photos conditioned on given text prompts. However existing personalized generation methods cannot simultaneously satisfy the requirements of high efficiency promising identity (ID) fidelity and flexible text controllability. In this work we introduce PhotoMaker an efficient personalized text-to-image generation method which mainly encodes an arbitrary number of input ID images into a stack ID embedding for preserving ID information. Such an embedding also empowers our method to be applied in many interesting scenarios such as when replacing the corresponding class word and when combining the characteristics of different identities. Besides to better drive the training of our PhotoMaker we propose an ID-oriented data creation pipeline to assemble the training data. Under the nourishment of the dataset constructed through the proposed pipeline our PhotoMaker demonstrates comparable performance to test-time fine-tuning-based methods yet provides significant speed improvements strong generalization capabilities and a wide range of applications.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_PhotoMaker_Customizing_Realistic_Human_Photos_via_Stacked_ID_Embedding_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Score-Guided Diffusion for 3D Human Recovery,"Stathopoulos, Anastasis, Han, Ligong, Metaxas, Dimitris",We present Score-Guided Human Mesh Recovery (ScoreHMR) an approach for solving inverse problems for 3D human pose and shape reconstruction. These inverse problems involve fitting a human body model to image observations traditionally solved through optimization techniques. ScoreHMR mimics model fitting approaches but alignment with the image observation is achieved through score guidance in the latent space of a diffusion model. The diffusion model is trained to capture the conditional distribution of the human model parameters given an input image. By guiding its denoising process with a task-specific score ScoreHMR effectively solves inverse problems for various applications without the need for retraining the task-agnostic diffusion model. We evaluate our approach on three settings/applications. These are: (i) single-frame model fitting; (ii) reconstruction from multiple uncalibrated views; (iii) reconstructing humans in video sequences. ScoreHMR consistently outperforms all optimization baselines on popular benchmarks across all settings. We make our code and models available on the project website: https://statho.github.io/ScoreHMR.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Stathopoulos_Score-Guided_Diffusion_for_3D_Human_Recovery_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Check Locate Rectify: A Training-Free Layout Calibration System for Text-to-Image Generation,"Gong, Biao, Huang, Siteng, Feng, Yutong, Zhang, Shiwei, Li, Yuyuan, Liu, Yu","Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable progress in generating realistic images. However challenges remain in accurately understanding and synthesizing the layout requirements in the textual prompts. To align the generated image with layout instructions we present a training-free layout calibration system SimM that intervenes in the generative process on the fly during inference time. Specifically following a ""check-locate-rectify"" pipeline the system first analyses the prompt to generate the target layout and compares it with the intermediate outputs to automatically detect errors. Then by moving the located activations and making intra- and inter-map adjustments the rectification process can be performed with negligible computational overhead. To evaluate SimM over a range of layout requirements we present a benchmark SimMBench that compensates for the lack of superlative spatial relations in existing datasets. And both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SimM in calibrating the layout inconsistencies.

Pose-Transformed Equivariant Network for 3D Point Trajectory Prediction,"Yu, Ruixuan, Sun, Jian",Predicting 3D point trajectory is a fundamental learning task which commonly should be equivariant under Euclidean transformation e.g. SE(3). The existing equivariant models are commonly based on the group equivariant convolution equivariant message passing vector neuron frame averaging etc. In this paper we propose a novel pose-transformed equivariant network in which the points are firstly uniquely normalized and then transformed by the learned pose transformations upon which the points after motion are predicted and aggregated. Under each transformed pose we design the point position predictor consisting of multiple Pose-Transformed Points Prediction blocks in which the global and local motions are estimated and aggregated. This framework can be proven to be equivariant to SE(3) transformation over 3D points. We evaluate the pose-transformed equivariant network on extensive datasets including human motion capture molecular dynamics modeling and dynamics simulation. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrated our SOTA performance compared with the existing equivariant networks for 3D point trajectory prediction.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yu_Pose-Transformed_Equivariant_Network_for_3D_Point_Trajectory_Prediction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Revisiting Sampson Approximations for Geometric Estimation Problems,"Rydell, Felix, Torres, Ang√©lica, Larsson, Viktor","Many problems in computer vision can be formulated as geometric estimation problems i.e. given a collection of measurements (e.g. point correspondences) we wish to fit a model (e.g. an essential matrix) that agrees with our observations. This necessitates some measure of how much an observation ""agrees"" with a given model. A natural choice is to consider the smallest perturbation that makes the observation exactly satisfy the constraints. However for many problems this metric is expensive or otherwise intractable to compute. The so-called Sampson error approximates this geometric error through a linearization scheme. For epipolar geometry the Sampson error is a popular choice and in practice known to yield very tight approximations of the corresponding geometric residual (the reprojection error). In this paper we revisit the Sampson approximation and provide new theoretical insights as to why and when this approximation works as well as provide explicit bounds on the tightness under some mild assumptions. Our theoretical results are validated in several experiments on real data and in the context of different geometric estimation tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Rydell_Revisiting_Sampson_Approximations_for_Geometric_Estimation_Problems_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Fixed Point Diffusion Models,"Bai, Xingjian, Melas-Kyriazi, Luke",We introduce the Fixed Point Diffusion Model (FPDM) a novel approach to image generation that integrates the concept of fixed point solving into the framework of diffusion-based generative modeling. Our approach embeds an implicit fixed point solving layer into the denoising network of a diffusion model transforming the diffusion process into a sequence of closely-related fixed point problems. Combined with a new stochastic training method this approach significantly reduces model size reduces memory usage and accelerates training. Moreover it enables the development of two new techniques to improve sampling efficiency: reallocating computation across timesteps and reusing fixed point solutions between timesteps. We conduct extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models on ImageNet FFHQ CelebA-HQ and LSUN-Church demonstrating substantial improvements in performance and efficiency. Compared to the state-of-the-art DiT model FPDM contains 87% fewer parameters consumes 60% less memory during training and improves image generation quality in situations where sampling computation or time is limited.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bai_Fixed_Point_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Residual Learning in Diffusion Models,"Zhang, Junyu, Liu, Daochang, Park, Eunbyung, Zhang, Shichao, Xu, Chang",Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable generative performance particularly with the introduction of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Nevertheless a gap emerges in the model sampling trajectory constructed by reverse-SDE due to the accumulation of score estimation and discretization errors. This gap results in a residual in the generated images adversely impacting the image quality. To remedy this we propose a novel residual learning framework built upon a correction function. The optimized function enables to improve image quality via rectifying the sampling trajectory effectively. Importantly our framework exhibits transferable residual correction ability i.e. a correction function optimized for one pre-trained DM can also enhance the sampling trajectory constructed by other different DMs on the same dataset. Experimental results on four widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and transferable capability of our framework.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Residual_Learning_in_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Beyond Textual Constraints: Learning Novel Diffusion Conditions with Fewer Examples,"Yu, Yuyang, Liu, Bangzhen, Zheng, Chenxi, Xu, Xuemiao, Zhang, Huaidong, He, Shengfeng",In this paper we delve into a novel aspect of learning novel diffusion conditions with datasets an order of magnitude smaller. The rationale behind our approach is the elimination of textual constraints during the few-shot learning process. To that end we implement two optimization strategies. The first prompt-free conditional learning utilizes a prompt-free encoder derived from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. This strategy is designed to adapt new conditions to the diffusion process by minimizing the textual-visual correlation thereby ensuring a more precise alignment between the generated content and the specified conditions. The second strategy entails condition-specific negative rectification which addresses the inconsistencies typically brought about by Classifier-free guidance in few-shot training contexts. Our extensive experiments across a variety of condition modalities demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework yielding results comparable to those obtained with datasets a thousand times larger. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Yuyan9Yu/BeyondTextConstraint.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yu_Beyond_Textual_Constraints_Learning_Novel_Diffusion_Conditions_with_Fewer_Examples_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Exploiting Style Latent Flows for Generalizing Deepfake Video Detection,"Choi, Jongwook, Kim, Taehoon, Jeong, Yonghyun, Baek, Seungryul, Choi, Jongwon",This paper presents a new approach for the detection of fake videos based on the analysis of style latent vectors and their abnormal behavior in temporal changes in the generated videos. We discovered that the generated facial videos suffer from the temporal distinctiveness in the temporal changes of style latent vectors which are inevitable during the generation of temporally stable videos with various facial expressions and geometric transformations. Our framework utilizes the StyleGRU module trained by contrastive learning to represent the dynamic properties of style latent vectors. Additionally we introduce a style attention module that integrates StyleGRU-generated features with content-based features enabling the detection of visual and temporal artifacts. We demonstrate our approach across various benchmark scenarios in deepfake detection showing its superiority in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation scenarios. Through further analysis we also validate the importance of using temporal changes of style latent vectors to improve the generality of deepfake video detection.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Choi_Exploiting_Style_Latent_Flows_for_Generalizing_Deepfake_Video_Detection_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Video-P2P: Video Editing with Cross-attention Control,"Liu, Shaoteng, Zhang, Yuechen, Li, Wenbo, Lin, Zhe, Jia, Jiaya",Video-P2P is the first framework for real-world video editing with cross-attention control. While attention control has proven effective for image editing with pre-trained image generation models there are currently no large-scale video generation models publicly available. Video-P2P addresses this limitation by adapting an image generation diffusion model to complete various video editing tasks. Specifically we propose to first tune a Text-to-Set (T2S) model to complete an approximate inversion and then optimize a shared unconditional embedding to achieve accurate video inversion with a small memory cost. We further prove that it is crucial for consistent video editing. For attention control we introduce a novel decoupled-guidance strategy which uses different guidance strategies for the source and target prompts. The optimized unconditional embedding for the source prompt improves reconstruction ability while an initialized unconditional embedding for the target prompt enhances editability. Incorporating the attention maps of these two branches enables detailed editing. These technical designs enable various text-driven editing applications including word swap prompt refinement and attention re-weighting. Video-P2P works well on real-world videos for generating new characters while optimally preserving their original poses and scenes. It significantly outperforms previous approaches.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Video-P2P_Video_Editing_with_Cross-attention_Control_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Hunting Attributes: Context Prototype-Aware Learning for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Tang, Feilong, Xu, Zhongxing, Qu, Zhaojun, Feng, Wei, Jiang, Xingjian, Ge, Zongyuan",Recent weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods strive to incorporate contextual knowledge to improve the completeness of class activation maps (CAM). In this work we argue that the knowledge bias between instances and contexts affects the capability of the prototype to sufficiently understand instance semantics. Inspired by prototype learning theory we propose leveraging prototype awareness to capture diverse and fine-grained feature attributes of instances. The hypothesis is that contextual prototypes might erroneously activate similar and frequently co-occurring object categories due to this knowledge bias. Therefore we propose to enhance the prototype representation ability by mitigating the bias to better capture spatial coverage in semantic object regions. With this goal we present a Context Prototype-Aware Learning (CPAL) strategy which leverages semantic context to enrich instance comprehension. The core of this method is to accurately capture intra-class variations in object features through context-aware prototypes facilitating the adaptation to the semantic attributes of various instances. We design feature distribution alignment to optimize prototype awareness aligning instance feature distributions with dense features. In addition a unified training framework is proposed to combine label-guided classification supervision and prototypes-guided self-supervision. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 show that CPAL significantly improves off-the-shelf methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

PIE-NeRF: Physics-based Interactive Elastodynamics with NeRF,"Feng, Yutao, Shang, Yintong, Li, Xuan, Shao, Tianjia, Jiang, Chenfanfu, Yang, Yin",We show that physics-based simulations can be seamlessly integrated with NeRF to generate high-quality elastodynamics of real-world objects. Unlike existing methods we discretize nonlinear hyperelasticity in a meshless way obviating the necessity for intermediate auxiliary shape proxies like a tetrahedral mesh or voxel grid. A quadratic generalized moving least square is employed to capture nonlinear dynamics and large deformation on the implicit model. Such meshless integration enables versatile simulations of complex and codimensional shapes. We adaptively place the least-square kernels according to the NeRF density field to significantly reduce the complexity of the nonlinear simulation. As a result physically realistic animations can be conveniently synthesized using our method for a wide range of hyperelastic materials at an interactive rate.

FlashAvatar: High-fidelity Head Avatar with Efficient Gaussian Embedding,"Xiang, Jun, Gao, Xuan, Guo, Yudong, Zhang, Juyong",We propose FlashAvatar a novel and lightweight 3D animatable avatar representation that could reconstruct a digital avatar from a short monocular video sequence in minutes and render high-fidelity photo-realistic images at 300FPS on a consumer-grade GPU. To achieve this we maintain a uniform 3D Gaussian field embedded in the surface of a parametric face model and learn extra spatial offset to model non-surface regions and subtle facial details. While full use of geometric priors can capture high-frequency facial details and preserve exaggerated expressions proper initialization can help reduce the number of Gaussians thus enabling super-fast rendering speed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FlashAvatar outperforms existing works regarding visual quality and personalized details and is almost an order of magnitude faster in rendering speed.

ZERO-IG: Zero-Shot Illumination-Guided Joint Denoising and Adaptive Enhancement for Low-Light Images,"Shi, Yiqi, Liu, Duo, Zhang, Liguo, Tian, Ye, Xia, Xuezhi, Fu, Xiaojing",This paper presents a novel zero-shot method for jointly denoising and enhancing real-word low-light images. The proposed method is independent of training data and noise distribution. Guided by illumination we integrate denoising and enhancing processes seamlessly enabling end-to-end training. Pairs of downsampled images are extracted from a single original low-light image and processed to preliminarily reduce noise. Based on the smoothness of illumination near-authentic illumination can be estimated from the denoised low-light image. Specifically the illumination is constrained by the denoised image's brightness uniformly amplifying pixels to raise overall brightness to normal-light level. We simultaneously restrict the illumination by scaling each pixel of the denoised image based on its intensity controlling the enhancement amplitude for different pixels. Applying the illumination to the original low-light image yields an adaptively enhanced reflection. This prevents under-enhancement and localized overexposure. Notably we concatenate the reflection with the illumination preserving their computational relationship to ultimately remove noise from the original low-light image in the form of reflection. This provides sufficient image information for the denoising procedure without changing the noise characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

FinePOSE: Fine-Grained Prompt-Driven 3D Human Pose Estimation via Diffusion Models,"Xu, Jinglin, Guo, Yijie, Peng, Yuxin",The 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) task uses 2D images or videos to predict human joint coordinates in 3D space. Despite recent advancements in deep learning-based methods they mostly ignore the capability of coupling accessible texts and naturally feasible knowledge of humans missing out on valuable implicit supervision to guide the 3D HPE task. Moreover previous efforts often study this task from the perspective of the whole human body neglecting fine-grained guidance hidden in different body parts. To this end we present a new Fine-Grained Prompt-Driven Denoiser based on a diffusion model for 3D HPE named FinePOSE. It consists of three core blocks enhancing the reverse process of the diffusion model: (1) Fine-grained Part-aware Prompt learning (FPP) block constructs fine-grained part-aware prompts via coupling accessible texts and naturally feasible knowledge of body parts with learnable prompts to model implicit guidance. (2) Fine-grained Prompt-pose Communication (FPC) block establishes fine-grained communications between learned part-aware prompts and poses to improve the denoising quality. (3) Prompt-driven Timestamp Stylization (PTS) block integrates learned prompt embedding and temporal information related to the noise level to enable adaptive adjustment at each denoising step. Extensive experiments on public single-human pose estimation datasets show that FinePOSE outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further extend FinePOSE to multi-human pose estimation. Achieving 34.3mm average MPJPE on the EgoHumans dataset demonstrates the potential of FinePOSE to deal with complex multi-human scenarios.

DreamPropeller: Supercharge Text-to-3D Generation with Parallel Sampling,"Zhou, Linqi, Shih, Andy, Meng, Chenlin, Ermon, Stefano",Recent methods such as Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and Variational Score Distillation (VSD) using 2D diffusion models for text-to-3D generation have demonstrated impressive generation quality. However the long generation time of such algorithms significantly degrades the user experience. To tackle this problem we propose DreamPropeller a drop-in acceleration algorithm that can be wrapped around any existing text-to-3D generation pipeline based on score distillation. Our framework generalizes Picard iterations a classical algorithm for parallel sampling an ODE path and can account for non-ODE paths such as momentum-based gradient updates and changes in dimensions during the optimization process as in many cases of 3D generation. We show that our algorithm trades parallel compute for wallclock time and empirically achieves up to 4.7x speedup with a negligible drop in generation quality for all tested frameworks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_DreamPropeller_Supercharge_Text-to-3D_Generation_with_Parallel_Sampling_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Dysen-VDM: Empowering Dynamics-aware Text-to-Video Diffusion with LLMs,"Fei, Hao, Wu, Shengqiong, Ji, Wei, Zhang, Hanwang, Chua, Tat-Seng",Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has gained increasing attention in the community in which the recently emerged diffusion models (DMs) have promisingly shown stronger performance than the past approaches. While existing state-of-the-art DMs are competent to achieve high-resolution video generation they may largely suffer from key limitations (e.g. action occurrence disorders crude video motions) with respect to the intricate temporal dynamics modeling one of the crux of video synthesis. In this work we investigate strengthening the awareness of video dynamics for DMs for high-quality T2V generation. Inspired by human intuition we design an innovative dynamic scene manager (dubbed as Dysen) module which includes (step-1) extracting from input text the key actions with proper time-order arrangement (step-2) transforming the action schedules into the dynamic scene graph (DSG) representations and (step-3) enriching the scenes in the DSG with sufficient and reasonable details. Taking advantage of the existing powerful LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) via in-context learning Dysen realizes (nearly) human-level temporal dynamics understanding.

General Object Foundation Model for Images and Videos at Scale,"Wu, Junfeng, Jiang, Yi, Liu, Qihao, Yuan, Zehuan, Bai, Xiang, Bai, Song",We present GLEE in this work an object-level foundation model for locating and identifying objects in images and videos. Through a unified framework GLEEaccomplishes detection segmentation tracking grounding and identification of arbitrary objects in the open world scenario for various object perception tasks. Adopting a cohesive learning strategy GLEE acquires knowledge from diverse data sources with varying supervision levels to formulate general object representations excelling in zero-shot transfer to new data and tasks. Specifically we employ an image encoder text encoder and visual prompter to handle multi-modal inputs enabling to simultaneously solve various object-centric downstream tasks while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Demonstrated through extensive training on over five million images from diverse benchmarks GLEE exhibits remarkable versatility and improved generalization performance efficiently tackling downstream tasks without the need for task-specific adaptation. By integrating large volumes of automatically labeled data we further enhance its zero-shot generalization capabilities. Additionally GLEE is capable of being integrated into Large Language Models serving as a foundational model to provide universal object-level information for multi-modal tasks. We hope that the versatility and universality of our method will mark a significant step in the development of efficient visual foundation models for AGI systems.

Inlier Confidence Calibration for Point Cloud Registration,"Yuan, Yongzhe, Wu, Yue, Fan, Xiaolong, Gong, Maoguo, Miao, Qiguang, Ma, Wenping",Inliers estimation constitutes a pivotal step in partially overlapping point cloud registration. Existing methods broadly obey coordinate-based scheme where inlier confidence is scored through simply capturing coordinate differences in the context. However this scheme results in massive inlier misinterpretation readily consequently affecting the registration performance. In this paper we explore to extend a new definition called inlier confidence calibration (ICC) to alleviate the above issues. Firstly we provide finely initial correspondences for ICC in order to generate high quality reference point cloud copy corresponding to the source point cloud. In particular we develop a soft assignment matrix optimization theorem that offers faster speed and greater precision compared to Sinkhorn. Benefiting from the high quality reference copy we argue the neighborhood patch formed by inlier and its neighborhood should have consistency between source point cloud and its reference copy. Based on this insight we construct transformation-invariant geometric constraints and capture geometric structure consistency to calibrate inlier confidence for estimated correspondences between source point cloud and its reference copy. Finally transformation is further calculated by the weighted SVD algorithm with the calibrated inlier confidence. Our model is trained in an unsupervised manner and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yuan_Inlier_Confidence_Calibration_for_Point_Cloud_Registration_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Readout Guidance: Learning Control from Diffusion Features,"Luo, Grace, Darrell, Trevor, Wang, Oliver, Goldman, Dan B, Holynski, Aleksander",We present Readout Guidance a method for controlling text-to-image diffusion models with learned signals. Readout Guidance uses readout heads lightweight networks trained to extract signals from the features of a pre-trained frozen diffusion model at every timestep. These readouts can encode single-image properties such as pose depth and edges; or higher-order properties that relate multiple images such as correspondence and appearance similarity. Furthermore by comparing the readout estimates to a user-defined target and back-propagating the gradient through the readout head these estimates can be used to guide the sampling process. Compared to prior methods for conditional generation Readout Guidance requires significantly fewer added parameters and training samples and offers a convenient and simple recipe for reproducing different forms of conditional control under a single framework with a single architecture and sampling procedure. We showcase these benefits in the applications of drag-based manipulation identity-consistent generation and spatially aligned control.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Luo_Readout_Guidance_Learning_Control_from_Diffusion_Features_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
A Unified Approach for Text- and Image-guided 4D Scene Generation,"Zheng, Yufeng, Li, Xueting, Nagano, Koki, Liu, Sifei, Hilliges, Otmar, De Mello, Shalini",Large-scale diffusion generative models are greatly simplifying image video and 3D asset creation from user provided text prompts and images. However the challenging problem of text-to-4D dynamic 3D scene generation with diffusion guidance remains largely unexplored. We propose Dream-in-4D which features a novel two-stage approach for text-to-4D synthesis leveraging (1) 3D and 2D diffusion guidance to effectively learn a high-quality static 3D asset in the first stage; (2) a deformable neural radiance field that explicitly disentangles the learned static asset from its deformation preserving quality during motion learning; and (3) a multi-resolution feature grid for the deformation field with a displacement total variation loss to effectively learn motion with video diffusion guidance in the second stage. Through a user preference study we demonstrate that our approach significantly advances image and motion quality 3D consistency and text fidelity for text-to-4D generation compared to baseline approaches. Thanks to its motion-disentangled representation Dream-in-4D can also be easily adapted for controllable generation where appearance is defined by one or multiple images without the need to modify the motion learning stage. Thus our method offers for the first time a unified approach for text-to-4D image-to-4D and personalized 4D generation tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zheng_A_Unified_Approach_for_Text-_and_Image-guided_4D_Scene_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
GaussianAvatar: Towards Realistic Human Avatar Modeling from a Single Video via Animatable 3D Gaussians,"Hu, Liangxiao, Zhang, Hongwen, Zhang, Yuxiang, Zhou, Boyao, Liu, Boning, Zhang, Shengping, Nie, Liqiang",We present GaussianAvatar an efficient approach to creating realistic human avatars with dynamic 3D appearances from a single video. We start by introducing animatable 3D Gaussians to explicitly represent humans in various poses and clothing styles. Such an explicit and animatable representation can fuse 3D appearances more efficiently and consistently from 2D observations. Our representation is further augmented with dynamic properties to support pose-dependent appearance modeling where a dynamic appearance network along with an optimizable feature tensor is designed to learn the motion-to-appearance mapping. Moreover by leveraging the differentiable motion condition our method enables a joint optimization of motions and appearances during avatar modeling which helps to tackle the long-standing issue of inaccurate motion estimation in monocular settings. The efficacy of GaussianAvatar is validated on both the public dataset and our collected dataset demonstrating its superior performances in terms of appearance quality and rendering efficiency.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hu_GaussianAvatar_Towards_Realistic_Human_Avatar_Modeling_from_a_Single_Video_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Mosaic-SDF for 3D Generative Models,"Yariv, Lior, Puny, Omri, Gafni, Oran, Lipman, Yaron",Current diffusion or flow-based generative models for 3D shapes divide to two: distilling pre-trained 2D image diffusion models and training directly on 3D shapes. When training a diffusion or flow models on 3D shapes a crucial design choice is the shape representation. An effective shape representation needs to adhere three design principles: it should allow an efficient conversion of large 3D datasets to the representation form; it should provide a good tradeoff of approximation power versus number of parameters; and it should have a simple tensorial form that is compatible with existing powerful neural architectures. While standard 3D shape representations such as volumetric grids and point clouds do not adhere to all these principles simultaneously we advocate in this paper a new representation that does. We introduce Mosaic-SDF (M-SDF): a simple 3D shape representation that approximates the Signed Distance Function (SDF) of a given shape by using a set of local grids spread near the shape's boundary. The M-SDF representation is fast to compute for each shape individually making it readily parallelizable; it is parameter efficient as it only covers the space around the shape's boundary; and it has a simple matrix form compatible with Transformer-based architectures. We demonstrate the efficacy of the M-SDF representation by using it to train a 3D generative flow model including class-conditioned generation with the ShapeNetCore-V2 (3D Warehouse) dataset and text-to-3D generation using a dataset of about 600k caption-shape pairs.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yariv_Mosaic-SDF_for_3D_Generative_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Diffusion Handles Enabling 3D Edits for Diffusion Models by Lifting Activations to 3D,"Pandey, Karran, Guerrero, Paul, Gadelha, Matheus, Hold-Geoffroy, Yannick, Singh, Karan, Mitra, Niloy J.",Diffusion handles is a novel approach to enable 3D object edits on diffusion images requiring only existing pre-trained diffusion models depth estimation without any fine-tuning or 3D object retrieval. The edited results remain plausible photo-real and preserve object identity. Diffusion handles address a critically missing facet of generative image-based creative design. Our key insight is to lift diffusion activations for a selected object to 3D using a proxy depth 3D-transform the depth and associated activations and project them back to image space. The diffusion process guided by the manipulated activations produces plausible edited images showing complex 3D occlusion and lighting effects. We evaluate diffusion handles: quantitatively on a large synthetic data benchmark; and qualitatively by a user study showing our output to be more plausible and better than prior art at both 3D editing and identity control.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Pandey_Diffusion_Handles_Enabling_3D_Edits_for_Diffusion_Models_by_Lifting_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Friendly Sharpness-Aware Minimization,"Li, Tao, Zhou, Pan, He, Zhengbao, Cheng, Xinwen, Huang, Xiaolin","Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been instrumental in improving deep neural network training by minimizing both training loss and loss sharpness. Despite the practical success the mechanisms behind SAM's generalization enhancements remain elusive limiting its progress in deep learning optimization. In this work we investigate SAM's core components for generalization improvement and introduce ""Friendly-SAM"" (F-SAM) to further enhance SAM's generalization. Our investigation reveals the key role of batch-specific stochastic gradient noise within the adversarial perturbation i.e. the current minibatch gradient which significantly influences SAM's generalization performance. By decomposing the adversarial perturbation in SAM into full gradient and stochastic gradient noise components we discover that relying solely on the full gradient component degrades generalization while excluding it leads to improved performance. The possible reason lies in the full gradient component's increase in sharpness loss for the entire dataset creating inconsistencies with the subsequent sharpness minimization step solely on the current minibatch data. Inspired by these insights F-SAM aims to mitigate the negative effects of the full gradient component. It removes the full gradient estimated by an exponentially moving average (EMA) of historical stochastic gradients and then leverages stochastic gradient noise for improved generalization. Moreover we provide theoretical validation for the EMA approximation and prove the convergence of F-SAM on non-convex problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization performance and robustness of F-SAM over vanilla SAM. Code is available at https://github.com/nblt/F-SAM.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_Friendly_Sharpness-Aware_Minimization_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
BIVDiff: A Training-Free Framework for General-Purpose Video Synthesis via Bridging Image and Video Diffusion Models,"Shi, Fengyuan, Gu, Jiaxi, Xu, Hang, Xu, Songcen, Zhang, Wei, Wang, Limin",Diffusion models have made tremendous progress in text-driven image and video generation. Now text-to-image foundation models are widely applied to various downstream image synthesis tasks such as controllable image generation and image editing while downstream video synthesis tasks are less explored for several reasons. First it requires huge memory and computation overhead to train a video generation foundation model. Even with video foundation models additional costly training is still required for downstream video synthesis tasks. Second although some works extend image diffusion models into videos in a training-free manner temporal consistency cannot be well preserved. Finally these adaption methods are specifically designed for one task and fail to generalize to different tasks. To mitigate these issues we propose a training-free general-purpose video synthesis framework coined as BIVDiff via bridging specific image diffusion models and general text-to-video foundation diffusion models. Specifically we first use a specific image diffusion model (e.g. ControlNet and Instruct Pix2Pix) for frame-wise video generation then perform Mixed Inversion on the generated video and finally input the inverted latents into the video diffusion models (e.g. VidRD and ZeroScope) for temporal smoothing. This decoupled framework enables flexible image model selection for different purposes with strong task generalization and high efficiency. To validate the effectiveness and general use of BIVDiff we perform a wide range of video synthesis tasks including controllable video generation video editing video inpainting and outpainting.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shi_BIVDiff_A_Training-Free_Framework_for_General-Purpose_Video_Synthesis_via_Bridging_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
NC-TTT: A Noise Constrastive Approach for Test-Time Training,"Osowiechi, David, Hakim, Gustavo A. Vargas, Noori, Mehrdad, Cheraghalikhani, Milad, Bahri, Ali, Yazdanpanah, Moslem, Ben Ayed, Ismail, Desrosiers, Christian",Despite their exceptional performance in vision tasks deep learning models often struggle when faced with domain shifts during testing. Test-Time Training (TTT) methods have recently gained popularity by their ability to enhance the robustness of models through the addition of an auxiliary objective that is jointly optimized with the main task. Being strictly unsupervised this auxiliary objective is used at test time to adapt the model without any access to labels. In this work we propose Noise-Contrastive Test-Time Training (NC-TTT) a novel unsupervised TTT technique based on the discrimination of noisy feature maps. By learning to classify noisy views of projected feature maps and then adapting the model accordingly on new domains classification performance can be recovered by an important margin. Experiments on several popular test-time adaptation baselines demonstrate the advantages of our method compared to recent approaches for this task. The code can be found at: https://github.com/GustavoVargasHakim/NCTTT.git,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Osowiechi_NC-TTT_A_Noise_Constrastive_Approach_for_Test-Time_Training_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Small Scale Data-Free Knowledge Distillation,"Liu, He, Wang, Yikai, Liu, Huaping, Sun, Fuchun, Yao, Anbang","Data-free knowledge distillation is able to utilize the knowledge learned by a large teacher network to augment the training of a smaller student network without accessing the original training data avoiding privacy security and proprietary risks in real applications. In this line of research existing methods typically follow an inversion-and-distillation paradigm in which a generative adversarial network on-the-fly trained with the guidance of the pre-trained teacher network is used to synthesize a large-scale sample set for knowledge distillation. In this paper we reexamine this common data-free knowledge distillation paradigm showing that there is considerable room to improve the overall training efficiency through a lens of ""small-scale inverted data for knowledge distillation"". In light of three empirical observations indicating the importance of how to balance class distributions in terms of synthetic sample diversity and difficulty during both data inversion and distillation processes we propose Small Scale Data-free Knowledge Distillation (SSD-KD). In formulation SSD-KD introduces a modulating function to balance synthetic samples and a priority sampling function to select proper samples facilitated by a dynamic replay buffer and a reinforcement learning strategy. As a result SSD-KD can perform distillation training conditioned on an extremely small scale of synthetic samples (e.g. 10x less than the original training data scale) making the overall training efficiency one or two orders of magnitude faster than many mainstream methods while retaining superior or competitive model performance as demonstrated on popular image classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks.

CFPL-FAS: Class Free Prompt Learning for Generalizable Face Anti-spoofing,"Liu, Ajian, Xue, Shuai, Gan, Jianwen, Wan, Jun, Liang, Yanyan, Deng, Jiankang, Escalera, Sergio, Lei, Zhen",Domain generalization (DG) based Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) aims to improve the model's performance on unseen domains. Existing methods either rely on domain labels to align domain-invariant feature spaces or disentangle generalizable features from the whole sample which inevitably lead to the distortion of semantic feature structures and achieve limited generalization. In this work we make use of large-scale VLMs like CLIP and leverage the textual feature to dynamically adjust the classifier's weights for exploring generalizable visual features. Specifically we propose a novel Class Free Prompt Learning (CFPL) paradigm for DG FAS which utilizes two lightweight transformers namely Content Q-Former (CQF) and Style Q-Former (SQF) to learn the different semantic prompts conditioned on content and style features by using a set of learnable query vectors respectively. Thus the generalizable prompt can be learned by two improvements: (1) A Prompt-Text Matched (PTM) supervision is introduced to ensure CQF learns visual representation that is most informative of the content description. (2) A Diversified Style Prompt (DSP) technology is proposed to diversify the learning of style prompts by mixing feature statistics between instance-specific styles. Finally the learned text features modulate visual features to generalization through the designed Prompt Modulation (PM). Extensive experiments show that the CFPL is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several cross-domain datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_CFPL-FAS_Class_Free_Prompt_Learning_for_Generalizable_Face_Anti-spoofing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Open Vocabulary Semantic Scene Sketch Understanding,"Bourouis, Ahmed, Fan, Judith E., Gryaditskaya, Yulia",We study the underexplored but fundamental vision problem of machine understanding of abstract freehand scene sketches. We introduce a sketch encoder that results in semantically-aware feature space which we evaluate by testing its performance on a semantic sketch segmentation task. To train our model we rely only on the availability of bitmap sketches with their brief captions and do not require any pixel-level annotations. To obtain generalization to a large set of sketches and categories we build on a vision transformer encoder pretrained with the CLIP model. We freeze the text encoder and perform visual-prompt tuning of the visual encoder branch while introducing a set of critical modifications. Firstly we augment the classical key-query (k-q) self-attention blocks with value-value (v-v) self-attention blocks. Central to our model is a two-level hierarchical network design that enables efficient semantic disentanglement: The first level ensures holistic scene sketch encoding and the second level focuses on individual categories. We then in the second level of the hierarchy introduce a cross-attention between textual and visual branches. Our method outperforms zero-shot CLIP pixel accuracy of segmentation results by 37 points reaching an accuracy of 85.5% on the FS-COCO sketch dataset. Finally we conduct a user study that allows us to identify further improvements needed over our method to reconcile machine and human understanding of scene sketches.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bourouis_Open_Vocabulary_Semantic_Scene_Sketch_Understanding_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
IntrinsicAvatar: Physically Based Inverse Rendering of Dynamic Humans from Monocular Videos via Explicit Ray Tracing,"Wang, Shaofei, Antic, Bozidar, Geiger, Andreas, Tang, Siyu",We present IntrinsicAvatar a novel approach to recovering the intrinsic properties of clothed human avatars including geometry albedo material and environment lighting from only monocular videos. Recent advancements in human-based neural rendering have enabled high-quality geometry and appearance reconstruction of clothed humans from just monocular videos. However these methods bake intrinsic properties such as albedo material and environment lighting into a single entangled neural representation. On the other hand only a handful of works tackle the problem of estimating geometry and disentangled appearance properties of clothed humans from monocular videos. They usually achieve limited quality and disentanglement due to approximations of secondary shading effects via learned MLPs. In this work we propose to model secondary shading effects explicitly via Monte-Carlo ray tracing. We model the rendering process of clothed humans as a volumetric scattering process and combine ray tracing with body articulation. Our approach can recover high-quality geometry albedo material and lighting properties of clothed humans from a single monocular video without requiring supervised pre-training using ground truth materials. Furthermore since we explicitly model the volumetric scattering process and ray tracing our model naturally generalizes to novel poses enabling animation of the reconstructed avatar in novel lighting conditions.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_IntrinsicAvatar_Physically_Based_Inverse_Rendering_of_Dynamic_Humans_from_Monocular_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Efficient Detection of Long Consistent Cycles and its Application to Distributed Synchronization,"Li, Shaohan, Shi, Yunpeng, Lerman, Gilad",Group synchronization plays a crucial role in global pipelines for Structure from Motion (SfM). Its formulation is nonconvex and it is faced with highly corrupted measurements. Cycle consistency has been effective in addressing these challenges. However computationally efficient solutions are needed for cycles longer than three especially in practical scenarios where 3-cycles are unavailable. To overcome this computational bottleneck we propose an algorithm for group synchronization that leverages information from cycles of lengths ranging from three to six with a complexity of O(n^3) (or O(n^ 2.373 ) when using a faster matrix multiplication algorithm). We establish non-trivial theory for this and related methods that achieves competitive sample complexity assuming the uniform corruption model. To advocate the practical need for our method we consider distributed group synchronization which requires at least 4-cycles and we illustrate state-of-the-art performance by our method in this context.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_Efficient_Detection_of_Long_Consistent_Cycles_and_its_Application_to_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Vlogger: Make Your Dream A Vlog,"Zhuang, Shaobin, Li, Kunchang, Chen, Xinyuan, Wang, Yaohui, Liu, Ziwei, Qiao, Yu, Wang, Yali",In this work we present Vlogger a generic AI system for generating a minute-level video blog (i.e. vlog) of user descriptions. Different from short videos with a few seconds vlog often contains a complex storyline with diversified scenes which is challenging for most existing video generation approaches. To break through this bottleneck our Vlogger smartly leverages Large Language Model (LLM) as Director and decomposes a long video generation task of vlog into four key stages where we invoke various foundation models to play the critical roles of vlog professionals including (1) Script (2) Actor (3) ShowMaker and (4) Voicer. With such a design of mimicking human beings our Vlogger can generate vlogs through explainable cooperation of top-down planning and bottom-up shooting. More over we introduce a novel video diffusion model ShowMaker which serves as a videographer in our Vlogger for generating the video snippet of each shooting scene. By incorporating Script and Actor attentively as textual and visual prompts it can effectively enhance spatial-temporal coherence in the snippet. Besides we design a concise mixed training paradigm for ShowMaker boosting its capacity for both T2V generation and prediction. Finally the extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot T2V generation and prediction tasks. More importantly Vlogger can generate over 5-minute vlogs from open-world descriptions without loss of video coherence on script and actor.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhuang_Vlogger_Make_Your_Dream_A_Vlog_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Neural 3D Strokes: Creating Stylized 3D Scenes with Vectorized 3D Strokes,"Duan, Hao-Bin, Wang, Miao, Li, Yan-Xun, Yang, Yong-Liang",We present Neural 3D Strokes a novel technique to generate stylized images of a 3D scene at arbitrary novel views from multi-view 2D images. Different from existing methods which apply stylization to trained neural radiance fields at the voxel level our approach draws inspiration from image-to-painting methods simulating the progressive painting process of human artwork with vector strokes. We develop a palette of stylized 3D strokes from basic primitives and splines and consider the 3D scene stylization task as a multi-view reconstruction process based on these 3D stroke primitives. Instead of directly searching for the parameters of these 3D strokes which would be too costly we introduce a differentiable renderer that allows optimizing stroke parameters using gradient descent and propose a training scheme to alleviate the vanishing gradient issue. The extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach effectively synthesizes 3D scenes with significant geometric and aesthetic stylization while maintaining a consistent appearance across different views. Our method can be further integrated with style loss and image-text contrastive models to extend its applications including color transfer and text-driven 3D scene drawing.

Multi-Object Tracking in the Dark,"Wang, Xinzhe, Ma, Kang, Liu, Qiankun, Zou, Yunhao, Fu, Ying",Low-light scenes are prevalent in real-world applications (e.g. autonomous driving and surveillance at night). Recently multi-object tracking in various practical use cases have received much attention but multi-object tracking in dark scenes is rarely considered. In this paper we focus on multi-object tracking in dark scenes. To address the lack of datasets we first build a Low-light Multi-Object Tracking (LMOT) dataset. LMOT provides well-aligned low-light video pairs captured by our dual-camera system and high-quality multi-object tracking annotations for all videos. Then we propose a low-light multi-object tracking method termed as LTrack. We introduce the adaptive low-pass downsample module to enhance low-frequency components of images outside the sensor noises. The degradation suppression learning strategy enables the model to learn invariant information under noise disturbance and image quality degradation. These components improve the robustness of multi-object tracking in dark scenes. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of our LMOT dataset and proposed LTrack. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and its competitiveness in real night low-light scenes.

UniHuman: A Unified Model For Editing Human Images in the Wild,"Li, Nannan, Liu, Qing, Singh, Krishna Kumar, Wang, Yilin, Zhang, Jianming, Plummer, Bryan A., Lin, Zhe",Human image editing includes tasks like changing a person's pose their clothing or editing the image according to a text prompt. However prior work often tackles these tasks separately overlooking the benefit of mutual reinforcement from learning them jointly. In this paper we propose UniHuman a unified model that addresses multiple facets of human image editing in real-world settings. To enhance the model's generation quality and generalization capacity we leverage guidance from human visual encoders and introduce a lightweight pose-warping module that can exploit different pose representations accommodating unseen textures and patterns. Furthermore to bridge the disparity between existing human editing benchmarks with real-world data we curated 400K high-quality human image-text pairs for training and collected 2K human images for out-of-domain testing both encompassing diverse clothing styles backgrounds and age groups. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets demonstrate that UniHuman outperforms task-specific models by a significant margin. In user studies UniHuman is preferred by the users in an average of 77% of cases.

DiffAgent: Fast and Accurate Text-to-Image API Selection with Large Language Model,"Zhao, Lirui, Yang, Yue, Zhang, Kaipeng, Shao, Wenqi, Zhang, Yuxin, Qiao, Yu, Luo, Ping, Ji, Rongrong",Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have attracted significant attention and found extensive applications within and beyond academic research. For example the Civitai community a platform for T2I innovation currently hosts an impressive array of 74492 distinct models. However this diversity presents a formidable challenge in selecting the most appropriate model and parameters a process that typically requires numerous trials. Drawing inspiration from the tool usage research of large language models (LLMs) we introduce DiffAgent an LLM agent designed to screen the accurate selection in seconds via API calls. DiffAgent leverages a novel two-stage training framework SFTA enabling it to accurately align T2I API responses with user input in accordance with human preferences. To train and evaluate DiffAgent's capabilities we present DABench a comprehensive dataset encompassing an extensive range of T2I APIs from the community.

In Search of a Data Transformation That Accelerates Neural Field Training,"Seo, Junwon, Lee, Sangyoon, Kim, Kwang In, Lee, Jaeho",Neural field is an emerging paradigm in data representation that trains a neural network to approximate the given signal. A key obstacle that prevents its widespread adoption is the encoding speed---generating neural fields requires an overfitting of a neural network which can take a significant number of SGD steps to reach the desired fidelity level. In this paper we delve into the impacts of data transformations on the speed of neural field training specifically focusing on how permuting pixel locations affect the convergence speed of SGD. Counterintuitively we find that randomly permuting the pixel locations can considerably accelerate the training. To explain this phenomenon we examine the neural field training through the lens of PSNR curves loss landscapes and error patterns. Our analyses suggest that the random pixel permutations remove the easy-to-fit patterns which facilitate easy optimization in the early stage but hinder capturing fine details of the signal.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Seo_In_Search_of_a_Data_Transformation_That_Accelerates_Neural_Field_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Towards 3D Vision with Low-Cost Single-Photon Cameras,"Mu, Fangzhou, Sifferman, Carter, Jungerman, Sacha, Li, Yiquan, Han, Mark, Gleicher, Michael, Gupta, Mohit, Li, Yin",We present a method for reconstructing 3D shape of arbitrary Lambertian objects based on measurements by miniature energy-efficient low-cost single-photon cameras. These cameras operating as time resolved image sensors illuminate the scene with a very fast pulse of diffuse light and record the shape of that pulse as it returns back from the scene at a high temporal resolution. We propose to model this image formation process account for its non-idealities and adapt neural rendering to reconstruct 3D geometry from a set of spatially distributed sensors with known poses. We show that our approach can successfully recover complex 3D shapes from simulated data. We further demonstrate 3D object reconstruction from real-world captures utilizing measurements from a commodity proximity sensor.

Unlike prior work on view generation that focuses on a single type of scenes we start at any user-provided location (by a text description or an image) and generate a journey through a long sequence of diverse yet coherently connected 3D scenes. We leverage an LLM to generate textual descriptions of the scenes in this journey a text-driven point cloud generation pipeline to make a compelling and coherent sequence of 3D scenes and a large VLM to verify the generated scenes. We show compelling diverse visual results across various scene types and styles forming imaginary ""wonderjourneys"".

4D-fy: Text-to-4D Generation Using Hybrid Score Distillation Sampling,"Bahmani, Sherwin, Skorokhodov, Ivan, Rong, Victor, Wetzstein, Gordon, Guibas, Leonidas, Wonka, Peter, Tulyakov, Sergey, Park, Jeong Joon, Tagliasacchi, Andrea, Lindell, David B.",Recent breakthroughs in text-to-4D generation rely on pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-video models to generate dynamic 3D scenes. However current text-to-4D methods face a three-way tradeoff between the quality of scene appearance 3D structure and motion. For example text-to-image models and their 3D-aware variants are trained on internet-scale image datasets and can be used to produce scenes with realistic appearance and 3D structure---but no motion. Text-to-video models are trained on relatively smaller video datasets and can produce scenes with motion but poorer appearance and 3D structure. While these models have complementary strengths they also have opposing weaknesses making it difficult to combine them in a way that alleviates this three-way tradeoff. Here we introduce hybrid score distillation sampling an alternating optimization procedure that blends supervision signals from multiple pre-trained diffusion models and incorporates benefits of each for high-fidelity text-to-4D generation. Using hybrid SDS we demonstrate synthesis of 4D scenes with compelling appearance 3D structure and motion.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bahmani_4D-fy_Text-to-4D_Generation_Using_Hybrid_Score_Distillation_Sampling_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FreeControl: Training-Free Spatial Control of Any Text-to-Image Diffusion Model with Any Condition,"Mo, Sicheng, Mu, Fangzhou, Lin, Kuan Heng, Liu, Yanli, Guan, Bochen, Li, Yin, Zhou, Bolei",Recent approaches such as ControlNet offer users fine-grained spatial control over text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. However auxiliary modules have to be trained for each spatial condition type model architecture and checkpoint putting them at odds with the diverse intents and preferences a human designer would like to convey to the AI models during the content creation process. In this work we present FreeControl a training-free approach for controllable T2I generation that supports multiple conditions architectures and checkpoints simultaneously. FreeControl enforces structure guidance to facilitate the global alignment with a guidance image and appearance guidance to collect visual details from images generated without control. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FreeControl across a variety of pre-trained T2I models. In particular FreeControl enables convenient training-free control over many different architectures and checkpoints allows the challenging input conditions on which most of the existing training-free methods fail and achieves competitive synthesis quality compared to training-based approaches.

VMC: Video Motion Customization using Temporal Attention Adaption for Text-to-Video Diffusion Models,"Jeong, Hyeonho, Park, Geon Yeong, Ye, Jong Chul",Text-to-video diffusion models have advanced video generation significantly. However customizing these models to generate videos with tailored motions presents a substantial challenge. In specific they encounter hurdles in (1) accurately reproducing motion from a target video and (2) creating diverse visual variations. For example straightforward extensions of static image customization methods to video often lead to intricate entanglements of appearance and motion data. To tackle this here we present the Video Motion Customization (VMC) framework a novel one-shot tuning approach crafted to adapt temporal attention layers within video diffusion models. Our approach introduces a novel motion distillation objective using residual vectors between consecutive noisy latent frames as a motion reference. The diffusion process then preserve low-frequency motion trajectories while mitigating high-frequency motion-unrelated noise in image space. We validate our method against state-of-the-art video generative models across diverse real-world motions and contexts. Our codes and data can be found at: https://video-motion-customization.github.io/,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jeong_VMC_Video_Motion_Customization_using_Temporal_Attention_Adaption_for_Text-to-Video_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DistriFusion: Distributed Parallel Inference for High-Resolution Diffusion Models,"Li, Muyang, Cai, Tianle, Cao, Jiaxin, Zhang, Qinsheng, Cai, Han, Bai, Junjie, Jia, Yangqing, Li, Kai, Han, Song",Diffusion models have achieved great success in synthesizing high-quality images. However generating high-resolution images with diffusion models is still challenging due to the enormous computational costs resulting in a prohibitive latency for interactive applications. In this paper we propose DistriFusion to tackle this problem by leveraging parallelism across multiple GPUs. Our method splits the model input into multiple patches and assigns each patch to a GPU. However naively implementing such an algorithm breaks the interaction between patches and loses fidelity while incorporating such an interaction will incur tremendous communication overhead. To overcome this dilemma we observe the high similarity between the input from adjacent diffusion steps and propose Displaced Patch Parallelism which takes advantage of the sequential nature of the diffusion process by reusing the pre-computed feature maps from the previous timestep to provide context for the current step. Therefore our method supports asynchronous communication which can be pipelined by computation. Extensive experiments show that our method can be applied to recent Stable Diffusion XL with no quality degradation and achieve up to a 6.1x speedup on eight NVIDIA A100s compared to one. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/distrifuser.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_DistriFusion_Distributed_Parallel_Inference_for_High-Resolution_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AZ-NAS: Assembling Zero-Cost Proxies for Network Architecture Search,"Lee, Junghyup, Ham, Bumsub",Training-free network architecture search (NAS) aims to discover high-performing networks with zero-cost proxies capturing network characteristics related to the final performance. However network rankings estimated by previous training-free NAS methods have shown weak correlations with the performance. To address this issue we propose AZ-NAS a novel approach that leverages the ensemble of various zero-cost proxies to enhance the correlation between a predicted ranking of networks and the ground truth substantially in terms of the performance. To achieve this we introduce four novel zero-cost proxies that are complementary to each other analyzing distinct traits of architectures in the views of expressivity progressivity trainability and complexity. The proxy scores can be obtained simultaneously within a single forward and backward pass making an overall NAS process highly efficient. In order to integrate the rankings predicted by our proxies effectively we introduce a non-linear ranking aggregation method that highlights the networks highly-ranked consistently across all the proxies. Experimental results conclusively demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of AZ-NAS outperforming state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks all while maintaining a reasonable runtime cost.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_AZ-NAS_Assembling_Zero-Cost_Proxies_for_Network_Architecture_Search_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Improving Physics-Augmented Continuum Neural Radiance Field-Based Geometry-Agnostic System Identification with Lagrangian Particle Optimization,"Kaneko, Takuhiro",Geometry-agnostic system identification is a technique for identifying the geometry and physical properties of an object from video sequences without any geometric assumptions. Recently physics-augmented continuum neural radiance fields (PAC-NeRF) has demonstrated promising results for this technique by utilizing a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation in which the geometry is represented by the Eulerian grid representations of NeRF the physics is described by a material point method (MPM) and they are connected via Lagrangian particles. However a notable limitation of PAC-NeRF is that its performance is sensitive to the learning of the geometry from the first frames owing to its two-step optimization. First the grid representations are optimized with the first frames of video sequences and then the physical properties are optimized through video sequences utilizing the fixed first-frame grid representations. This limitation can be critical when learning of the geometric structure is difficult for example in a few-shot (sparse view) setting. To overcome this limitation we propose Lagrangian particle optimization (LPO) in which the positions and features of particles are optimized through video sequences in Lagrangian space. This method allows for the optimization of the geometric structure across the entire video sequence within the physical constraints imposed by the MPM. The experimental results demonstrate that the LPO is useful for geometric correction and physical identification in sparse-view settings.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kaneko_Improving_Physics-Augmented_Continuum_Neural_Radiance_Field-Based_Geometry-Agnostic_System_Identification_with_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Beyond Image Super-Resolution for Image Recognition with Task-Driven Perceptual Loss,"Kim, Jaeha, Oh, Junghun, Lee, Kyoung Mu",In real-world scenarios image recognition tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection often pose greater challenges due to the lack of information available within low-resolution (LR) content. Image super-resolution (SR) is one of the promising solutions for addressing the challenges. However due to the ill-posed property of SR it is challenging for typical SR methods to restore task-relevant high-frequency contents which may dilute the advantage of utilizing the SR method. Therefore in this paper we propose Super-Resolution for Image Recognition (SR4IR) that effectively guides the generation of SR images beneficial to achieving satisfactory image recognition performance when processing LR images. The critical component of our SR4IR is the task-driven perceptual (TDP) loss that enables the SR network to acquire task-specific knowledge from a network tailored for a specific task. Moreover we propose a cross-quality patch mix and an alternate training framework that significantly enhances the efficacy of the TDP loss by addressing potential problems when employing the TDP loss. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that our SR4IR achieves outstanding task performance by generating SR images useful for a specific image recognition task including semantic segmentation object detection and image classification. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/JaehaKim97/SR4IR.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kim_Beyond_Image_Super-Resolution_for_Image_Recognition_with_Task-Driven_Perceptual_Loss_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
XCube: Large-Scale 3D Generative Modeling using Sparse Voxel Hierarchies,"Ren, Xuanchi, Huang, Jiahui, Zeng, Xiaohui, Museth, Ken, Fidler, Sanja, Williams, Francis",We present XCube a novel generative model for high-resolution sparse 3D voxel grids with arbitrary attributes. Our model can generate millions of voxels with a finest effective resolution of up to 1024^3 in a feed-forward fashion without time-consuming test-time optimization. To achieve this we employ a hierarchical voxel latent diffusion model which generates progressively higher resolution grids in a coarse-to-fine manner using a custom framework built on the highly efficient VDB data structure. Apart from generating high-resolution objects we demonstrate the effectiveness of XCube on large outdoor scenes at scales of 100m x 100m with a voxel size as small as 10cm. We observe clear qualitative and quantitative improvements over past approaches. In addition to unconditional generation we show that our model can be used to solve a variety of tasks such as user-guided editing scene completion from a single scan and text-to-3D.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ren_XCube_Large-Scale_3D_Generative_Modeling_using_Sparse_Voxel_Hierarchies_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Reconstruction-free Cascaded Adaptive Compressive Sensing,"Qiu, Chenxi, Yue, Tao, Hu, Xuemei",Scene-aware Adaptive Compressive Sensing (ACS) has constituted a persistent pursuit holding substantial promise for the enhancement of Compressive Sensing (CS) performance. Cascaded ACS furnishes a proficient multi-stage framework for adaptively allocating the CS sampling based on previous CS measurements. However reconstruction is commonly required for analyzing and steering the successive CS sampling which bottlenecks the ACS speed and impedes the practical application in time-sensitive scenarios. Addressing this challenge we propose a reconstruction-free cascaded ACS method which requires NO reconstruction during the adaptive sampling process. A lightweight Score Network (ScoreNet) is proposed to directly determine the ACS allocation with previous CS measurements and a differentiable adaptive sampling module is proposed for end-to-end training. For image reconstruction we propose a Multi-Grid Spatial-Attention Network (MGSANet) that could facilitate efficient multi-stage training and inferencing. By introducing the reconstruction-fidelity supervision outside the loop of the multi-stage sampling process ACS can be efficiently optimized and achieve high imaging fidelity. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments compared with the state-of-the-art CS algorithms.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Qiu_Reconstruction-free_Cascaded_Adaptive_Compressive_Sensing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
USE: Universal Segment Embeddings for Open-Vocabulary Image Segmentation,"Wang, Xiaoqi, He, Wenbin, Xuan, Xiwei, Sebastian, Clint, Ono, Jorge Piazentin, Li, Xin, Behpour, Sima, Doan, Thang, Gou, Liang, Shen, Han-Wei, Ren, Liu",The open-vocabulary image segmentation task involves partitioning images into semantically meaningful segments and classifying them with flexible text-defined categories. The recent vision-based foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown superior performance in generating class-agnostic image segments. The main challenge in open-vocabulary image segmentation now lies in accurately classifying these segments into text-defined categories. In this paper we introduce the Universal Segment Embedding (USE) framework to address this challenge. This framework is comprised of two key components: 1) a data pipeline designed to efficiently curate a large amount of segment-text pairs at various granularities and 2) a universal segment embedding model that enables precise segment classification into a vast range of text-defined categories. The USE model can not only help open-vocabulary image segmentation but also facilitate other downstream tasks (e.g. querying and ranking). Through comprehensive experimental studies on semantic segmentation and part segmentation benchmarks we demonstrate that the USE framework outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_USE_Universal_Segment_Embeddings_for_Open-Vocabulary_Image_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Functional Diffusion,"Zhang, Biao, Wonka, Peter",We propose functional diffusion a generative diffusion model focused on infinite-dimensional function data samples. In contrast to previous work functional diffusion works on samples that are represented by functions with a continuous domain. Functional diffusion can be seen as an extension of classical diffusion models to an infinite-dimensional domain. Functional diffusion is very versatile as images videos audio 3D shapes deformations etc. can be handled by the same framework with minimal changes. In addition functional diffusion is especially suited for irregular data or data defined in non-standard domains. In our work we derive the necessary foundations for functional diffusion and propose a first implementation based on the transformer architecture. We show generative results on complicated signed distance functions and deformation functions defined on 3D surfaces.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Functional_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Wired Perspectives: Multi-View Wire Art Embraces Generative AI,"Qu, Zhiyu, Yang, Lan, Zhang, Honggang, Xiang, Tao, Pang, Kaiyue, Song, Yi-Zhe",Creating multi-view wire art (MVWA) a static 3D sculpture with diverse interpretations from different viewpoints is a complex task even for skilled artists. In response we present DreamWire an AI system enabling everyone to craft MVWA easily. Users express their vision through text prompts or scribbles freeing them from intricate 3D wire organisation. Our approach synergises 3D Bezier curves Prim's algorithm and knowledge distillation from diffusion models or their variants (e.g. ControlNet). This blend enables the system to represent 3D wire art ensuring spatial continuity and overcoming data scarcity. Extensive evaluation and analysis are conducted to shed insight on the inner workings of the proposed system including the trade-off between connectivity and visual aesthetics.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Qu_Wired_Perspectives_Multi-View_Wire_Art_Embraces_Generative_AI_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Leveraging Camera Triplets for Efficient and Accurate Structure-from-Motion,"Manam, Lalit, Govindu, Venu Madhav",In Structure-from-Motion (SfM) the underlying viewgraphs of unordered image collections generally have a highly redundant set of edges that can be sparsified for efficiency without significant loss of reconstruction quality. Often there are also false edges due to incorrect image retrieval and repeated structures (symmetries) that give rise to ghosting and superimposed reconstruction artifacts. We present a unified method to simultaneously sparsify the viewgraph and remove false edges. We propose a scoring mechanism based on camera triplets that identifies edge redundancy as well as false edges. Our edge selection is formulated as an optimization problem which can be provably solved using a simple thresholding scheme. This results in a highly efficient algorithm which can be incorporated as a pre-processing step into any SfM pipeline making it practically usable. We demonstrate the utility of our method on generic and ambiguous datasets that cover the range of small medium and large-scale datasets all with different statistical properties. Sparsification of generic datasets using our method significantly reduces reconstruction time while maintaining the accuracy of the reconstructions as well as removing ghosting artifacts. For ambiguous datasets our method removes false edges thereby avoiding incorrect superimposed reconstructions.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Manam_Leveraging_Camera_Triplets_for_Efficient_and_Accurate_Structure-from-Motion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SimDA: Simple Diffusion Adapter for Efficient Video Generation,"Xing, Zhen, Dai, Qi, Hu, Han, Wu, Zuxuan, Jiang, Yu-Gang",The recent wave of AI-generated content has witnessed the great development and success of Text-to-Image (T2I) technologies. By contrast Text-to-Video (T2V) still falls short of expectations though attracting increasing interest. Existing works either train from scratch or adapt large T2I model to videos both of which are computation and resource expensive. In this work we propose a Simple Diffusion Adapter (SimDA) that fine-tunes only 24M out of 1.1B parameters of a strong T2I model adapting it to video generation in a parameter-efficient way. In particular we turn the T2I model for T2V by designing light-weight spatial and temporal adapters for transfer learning. Besides we change the original spatial attention to the proposed Latent-Shift Attention (LSA) for temporal consistency. With a similar model architecture we further train a video super-resolution model to generate high-definition (1024 x 1024) videos. In addition to T2V generation in the wild SimDA could also be utilized in one-shot video editing with only 2 minutes tuning. Doing so our method could minimize the training effort with extremely few tunable parameters for model adaptation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xing_SimDA_Simple_Diffusion_Adapter_for_Efficient_Video_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Multi-view Aggregation Network for Dichotomous Image Segmentation,"Yu, Qian, Zhao, Xiaoqi, Pang, Youwei, Zhang, Lihe, Lu, Huchuan",Dichotomous Image Segmentation (DIS) has recently emerged towards high-precision object segmentation from high-resolution natural images. When designing an effective DIS model the main challenge is how to balance the semantic dispersion of high-resolution targets in the small receptive field and the loss of high-precision details in the large receptive field. Existing methods rely on tedious multiple encoder-decoder streams and stages to gradually complete the global localization and local refinement. Human visual system captures regions of interest by observing them from multiple views. Inspired by it we model DIS as a multi-view object perception problem and provide a parsimonious multi-view aggregation network (MVANet) which unifies the feature fusion of the distant view and close-up view into a single stream with one encoder-decoder structure. With the help of the proposed multi-view complementary localization and refinement modules our approach established long-range profound visual interactions across multiple views allowing the features of the detailed close-up view to focus on highly slender structures. Experiments on the popular DIS-5K dataset show that our MVANet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed. The source code and datasets will be publicly available at \href https://github.com/qianyu-dlut/MVANet  MVANet .,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yu_Multi-view_Aggregation_Network_for_Dichotomous_Image_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
A Recipe for Scaling up Text-to-Video Generation with Text-free Videos,"Wang, Xiang, Zhang, Shiwei, Yuan, Hangjie, Qing, Zhiwu, Gong, Biao, Zhang, Yingya, Shen, Yujun, Gao, Changxin, Sang, Nong",Diffusion-based text-to-video generation has witnessed impressive progress in the past year yet still falls behind text-to-image generation. One of the key reasons is the limited scale of publicly available data (e.g. 10M video-text pairs in WebVid10M vs. 5B image-text pairs in LAION) considering the high cost of video captioning. Instead it could be far easier to collect unlabeled clips from video platforms like YouTube. Motivated by this we come up with a novel text-to-video generation framework termed TF-T2V which can directly learn with text-free videos. The rationale behind is to separate the process of text decoding from that of temporal modeling. To this end we employ a content branch and a motion branch which are jointly optimized with weights shared. Following such a pipeline we study the effect of doubling the scale of training set (i.e. video-only WebVid10M) with some randomly collected text-free videos and are encouraged to observe the performance improvement (FID from 9.67 to 8.19 and FVD from 484 to 441) demonstrating the scalability of our approach. We also find that our model could enjoy sustainable performance gain (FID from 8.19 to 7.64 and FVD from 441 to 366) after reintroducing some text labels for training. Finally we validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our ideology on both native text-to-video generation and compositional video synthesis paradigms. Code and models will be publicly available at here.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_A_Recipe_for_Scaling_up_Text-to-Video_Generation_with_Text-free_Videos_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Molecular Data Programming: Towards Molecule Pseudo-labeling with Systematic Weak Supervision,"Juan, Xin, Zhou, Kaixiong, Liu, Ninghao, Chen, Tianlong, Wang, Xin",The premise for the great advancement of molecular machine learning is dependent on a considerable amount of labeled data. In many real-world scenarios the labeled molecules are limited in quantity or laborious to derive. Recent pseudo-labeling methods are usually designed based on a single domain knowledge thereby failing to understand the comprehensive molecular configurations and limiting their adaptability to generalize across diverse biochemical context. To this end we introduce an innovative paradigm for dealing with the molecule pseudo-labeling named as Molecular Data Programming (MDP). In particular we adopt systematic supervision sources via crafting multiple graph labeling functions which covers various molecular structural knowledge of graph kernels molecular fingerprints and topological features. Each of them creates an uncertain and biased labels for the unlabeled molecules. To address the decision conflicts among the diverse pseudo-labels we design a label synchronizer to differentiably model confidences and correlations between the labeling functions which yields probabilistic molecular labels to adapt for specific applications. These probabilistic molecular labels are used to train a molecular classifier for improving its generalization capability. On eight benchmark datasets we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of MDP on the weakly supervised molecule classification tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Juan_Molecular_Data_Programming_Towards_Molecule_Pseudo-labeling_with_Systematic_Weak_Supervision_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Residual Denoising Diffusion Models,"Liu, Jiawei, Wang, Qiang, Fan, Huijie, Wang, Yinong, Tang, Yandong, Qu, Liangqiong",We propose residual denoising diffusion models (RDDM) a novel dual diffusion process that decouples the traditional single denoising diffusion process into residual diffusion and noise diffusion. This dual diffusion framework expands the denoising-based diffusion models initially uninterpretable for image restoration into a unified and interpretable model for both image generation and restoration by introducing residuals. Specifically our residual diffusion represents directional diffusion from the target image to the degraded input image and explicitly guides the reverse generation process for image restoration while noise diffusion represents random perturbations in the diffusion process. The residual prioritizes certainty while the noise emphasizes diversity enabling RDDM to effectively unify tasks with varying certainty or diversity requirements such as image generation and restoration. We demonstrate that our sampling process is consistent with that of DDPM and DDIM through coefficient transformation and propose a partially path-independent generation process to better understand the reverse process. Notably our RDDM enables a generic UNet trained with only an L1 loss and a batch size of 1 to compete with state-of-the-art image restoration methods. We provide code and pre-trained models to encourage further exploration application and development of our innovative framework (https://github.com/nachifur/RDDM).,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Residual_Denoising_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Towards Accurate and Robust Architectures via Neural Architecture Search,"Ou, Yuwei, Feng, Yuqi, Sun, Yanan",To defend deep neural networks from adversarial attacks adversarial training has been drawing increasing attention for its effectiveness. However the accuracy and robustness resulting from the adversarial training are limited by the architecture because adversarial training improves accuracy and robustness by adjusting the weight connection affiliated to the architecture. In this work we propose ARNAS to search for accurate and robust architectures for adversarial training. First we design an accurate and robust search space in which the placement of the cells and the proportional relationship of the filter numbers are carefully determined. With the design the architectures can obtain both accuracy and robustness by deploying accurate and robust structures to their sensitive positions respectively. Then we propose a differentiable multi-objective search strategy performing gradient descent towards directions that are beneficial for both natural loss and adversarial loss thus the accuracy and robustness can be guaranteed at the same time. We conduct comprehensive experiments in terms of white-box attacks black-box attacks and transferability. Experimental results show that the searched architecture has the strongest robustness with the competitive accuracy and breaks the traditional idea that NAS-based architectures cannot transfer well to complex tasks in robustness scenarios. By analyzing outstanding architectures searched we also conclude that accurate and robust neural architectures tend to deploy different structures near the input and output which has great practical significance on both hand-crafting and automatically designing of accurate and robust architectures.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ou_Towards_Accurate_and_Robust_Architectures_via_Neural_Architecture_Search_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Closely Interactive Human Reconstruction with Proxemics and Physics-Guided Adaption,"Huang, Buzhen, Li, Chen, Xu, Chongyang, Pan, Liang, Wang, Yangang, Lee, Gim Hee",Existing multi-person human reconstruction approaches mainly focus on recovering accurate poses or avoiding penetration but overlook the modeling of close interactions. In this work we tackle the task of reconstructing closely interactive humans from a monocular video. The main challenge of this task comes from insufficient visual information caused by depth ambiguity and severe inter-person occlusion. In view of this we propose to leverage knowledge from proxemic behavior and physics to compensate the lack of visual information. This is based on the observation that human interaction has specific patterns following the social proxemics. Specifically we first design a latent representation based on Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to model human interaction. A proxemics and physics guided diffusion model is then introduced to denoise the initial distribution. We design the diffusion model as dual branch with each branch representing one individual such that the interaction can be modeled via cross attention. With the learned priors of VQ-VAE and physical constraint as the additional information our proposed approach is capable of estimating accurate poses that are also proxemics and physics plausible. Experimental results on Hi4D 3DPW and CHI3D demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.

Taming Stable Diffusion for Text to 360 Panorama Image Generation,"Zhang, Cheng, Wu, Qianyi, Gambardella, Camilo Cruz, Huang, Xiaoshui, Phung, Dinh, Ouyang, Wanli, Cai, Jianfei",Generative models e.g. Stable Diffusion have enabled the creation of photorealistic images from text prompts. Yet the generation of 360-degree panorama images from text remains a challenge particularly due to the dearth of paired text-panorama data and the domain gap between panorama and perspective images. In this paper we introduce a novel dual-branch diffusion model named PanFusion to generate a 360-degree image from a text prompt. We leverage the stable diffusion model as one branch to provide prior knowledge in natural image generation and register it to another panorama branch for holistic image generation. We propose a unique cross-attention mechanism with projection awareness to minimize distortion during the collaborative denoising process. Our experiments validate that PanFusion surpasses existing methods and thanks to its dual-branch structure can integrate additional constraints like room layout for customized panorama outputs.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Taming_Stable_Diffusion_for_Text_to_360_Panorama_Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Modular Blind Video Quality Assessment,"Wen, Wen, Li, Mu, Zhang, Yabin, Liao, Yiting, Li, Junlin, Zhang, Li, Ma, Kede",Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) plays a pivotal role in evaluating and improving the viewing experience of end-users across a wide range of video-based platforms and services. Contemporary deep learning-based models primarily analyze video content in its aggressively subsampled format while being blind to the impact of the actual spatial resolution and frame rate on video quality. In this paper we propose a modular BVQA model and a method of training it to improve its modularity. Our model comprises a base quality predictor a spatial rectifier and a temporal rectifier responding to the visual content and distortion spatial resolution and frame rate changes on video quality respectively. During training spatial and temporal rectifiers are dropped out with some probabilities to render the base quality predictor a standalone BVQA model which should work better with the rectifiers. Extensive experiments on both professionally-generated content and user-generated content video databases show that our quality model achieves superior or comparable performance to current methods. Additionally the modularity of our model offers an opportunity to analyze existing video quality databases in terms of their spatial and temporal complexity.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wen_Modular_Blind_Video_Quality_Assessment_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
RELI11D: A Comprehensive Multimodal Human Motion Dataset and Method,"Yan, Ming, Zhang, Yan, Cai, Shuqiang, Fan, Shuqi, Lin, Xincheng, Dai, Yudi, Shen, Siqi, Wen, Chenglu, Xu, Lan, Ma, Yuexin, Wang, Cheng",Comprehensive capturing of human motions requires both accurate captures of complex poses and precise localization of the human within scenes. Most of the HPE datasets and methods primarily rely on RGB LiDAR or IMU data. However solely using these modalities or a combination of them may not be adequate for HPE particularly for complex and fast movements. For holistic human motion understanding we present RELI11D a high-quality multimodal human motion dataset involves LiDAR IMU system RGB camera and Event camera. It records the motions of 10 actors performing 5 sports in 7 scenes including 3.32 hours of synchronized LiDAR point clouds IMU measurement data RGB videos and Event steams. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that the RELI11D presents considerable challenges and opportunities as it contains many rapid and complex motions that require precise location. To address the challenge of integrating different modalities we propose LEIR a multimodal baseline that effectively utilizes LiDAR Point Cloud Event stream and RGB through our cross-attention fusion strategy. We show that LEIR exhibits promising results for rapid motions and daily motions and that utilizing the characteristics of multiple modalities can indeed improve HPE performance. Both the dataset and source code will be released publicly to the research community fostering collaboration and enabling further exploration in this field.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yan_RELI11D_A_Comprehensive_Multimodal_Human_Motion_Dataset_and_Method_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
One-Class Face Anti-spoofing via Spoof Cue Map-Guided Feature Learning,"Huang, Pei-Kai, Chiang, Cheng-Hsuan, Chen, Tzu-Hsien, Chong, Jun-Xiong, Liu, Tyng-Luh, Hsu, Chiou-Ting","Many face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have focused on learning discriminative features from both live and spoof training data to strengthen the security of face recognition systems. However since not every possible attack type is available in the training stage these FAS methods usually fail to detect unseen attacks in the inference stage. In comparison one-class FAS where the training data are from only live faces aims to detect whether a test face image belongs to the live class or not. In this paper we propose a novel One-Class Spoof Cue Map estimation Network (OC-SCMNet) to address the one-class FAS detection problem. Our first goal is to learn to extract latent spoof features from live images so that their estimated Spoof Cue Maps (SCMs) should have zero responses. To avoid trapping to a trivial solution we devise a novel SCM-guided feature learning by combining many SCMs as pseudo ground-truths to guide a conditional generator to generate latent spoof features for spoof data. Our second goal is to approximately simulate the potential out-of-distribution spoof attacks. To this end we propose using a memory bank to dynamically preserve a set of sufficiently ""independent"" latent spoof features to encourage the generator to probe the latent spoof feature space. Extensive experiments conducted on eight FAS benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed OC-SCMNet not only outperforms previous one-class FAS methods but also achieves comparable performances to state-of-the-art two-class FAS method. The codes are available at https://github.com/Pei-KaiHuang/CVPR24_OC_SCMNet.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Huang_One-Class_Face_Anti-spoofing_via_Spoof_Cue_Map-Guided_Feature_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
InteractDiffusion: Interaction Control in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Hoe, Jiun Tian, Jiang, Xudong, Chan, Chee Seng, Tan, Yap-Peng, Hu, Weipeng",Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have showcased incredible capabilities in generating coherent images based on textual descriptions enabling vast applications in content generation. While recent advancements have introduced control over factors such as object localization posture and image contours a crucial gap remains in our ability to control the interactions between objects in the generated content. Well-controlling interactions in generated images could yield meaningful applications such as creating realistic scenes with interacting characters. In this work we study the problems of conditioning T2I diffusion models with Human-Object Interaction (HOI) information consisting of a triplet label (person action object) and corresponding bounding boxes. We propose a pluggable interaction control model called InteractDiffusion that extends existing pre-trained T2I diffusion models to enable them being better conditioned on interactions. Specifically we tokenize the HOI information and learn their relationships via interaction embeddings. A conditioning self-attention layer is trained to map HOI tokens to visual tokens thereby conditioning the visual tokens better in existing T2I diffusion models. Our model attains the ability to control the interaction and location on existing T2I diffusion models which outperforms existing baselines by a large margin in HOI detection score as well as fidelity in FID and KID.

Emergent Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation from Off-the-shelf Vision-Language Models,"Luo, Jiayun, Khandelwal, Siddhesh, Sigal, Leonid, Li, Boyang",From image-text pairs large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) learn to implicitly associate image regions with words which prove effective for tasks like visual question answering. However leveraging the learned association for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper we propose a simple yet extremely effective training-free technique Plug-and-Play Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (PnP-OVSS) for this task. PnP-OVSS leverages a VLM with direct text-to-image cross-attention and an image-text matching loss. To balance between over-segmentation and under-segmentation we introduce Salience Dropout; by iteratively dropping patches that the model is most attentive to we are able to better resolve the entire extent of the segmentation mask. PnP-OVSS does not require any neural network training and performs hyperparameter tuning without the need for any segmentation annotations even for a validation set. PnP-OVSS demonstrates substantial improvements over comparable baselines (+29.4% mIoU on Pascal VOC +13.2% mIoU on Pascal Context +14.0% mIoU on MS COCO +2.4% mIoU on COCO Stuff) and even outperforms most baselines that conduct additional network training on top of pretrained VLMs. Our codebase is at https://github.com/letitiabanana/PnP-OVSS.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Luo_Emergent_Open-Vocabulary_Semantic_Segmentation_from_Off-the-shelf_Vision-Language_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SelfPose3d: Self-Supervised Multi-Person Multi-View 3d Pose Estimation,"Srivastav, Vinkle, Chen, Keqi, Padoy, Nicolas",We present a new self-supervised approach SelfPose3d for estimating 3d poses of multiple persons from multiple camera views. Unlike current state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods our approach does not require any 2d or 3d ground-truth poses and uses only the multi-view input images from a calibrated camera setup and 2d pseudo poses generated from an off-the-shelf 2d human pose estimator. We propose two self-supervised learning objectives: self-supervised person localization in 3d space and self-supervised 3d pose estimation. We achieve self-supervised 3d person localization by training the model on synthetically generated 3d points serving as 3d person root positions and on the projected root-heatmaps in all the views. We then model the 3d poses of all the localized persons with a bottleneck representation map them onto all views obtaining 2d joints and render them using 2d Gaussian heatmaps in an end-to-end differentiable manner. Afterwards we use the corresponding 2d joints and heatmaps from the pseudo 2d poses for learning. To alleviate the intrinsic inaccuracy of the pseudo labels we propose an adaptive supervision attention mechanism to guide the self-supervision. Our experiments and analysis on three public benchmark datasets including Panoptic Shelf and Campus show the effectiveness of our approach which is comparable to fully-supervised methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CAMMA-public/SelfPose3D.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Srivastav_SelfPose3d_Self-Supervised_Multi-Person_Multi-View_3d_Pose_Estimation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Joint2Human: High-Quality 3D Human Generation via Compact Spherical Embedding of 3D Joints,"Zhang, Muxin, Feng, Qiao, Su, Zhuo, Wen, Chao, Xue, Zhou, Li, Kun",3D human generation is increasingly significant in various applications. However the direct use of 2D generative methods in 3D generation often results in losing local details while methods that reconstruct geometry from generated images struggle with global view consistency. In this work we introduce Joint2Human a novel method that leverages 2D diffusion models to generate detailed 3D human geometry directly ensuring both global structure and local details. To achieve this we employ the Fourier occupancy field (FOF) representation enabling the direct generation of 3D shapes as preliminary results with 2D generative models. With the proposed high-frequency enhancer and the multi-view recarving strategy our method can seamlessly integrate the details from different views into a uniform global shape. To better utilize the 3D human prior and enhance control over the generated geometry we introduce a compact spherical embedding of 3D joints. This allows for an effective guidance of pose during the generation process. Additionally our method can generate 3D humans guided by textual inputs. Our experimental results demonstrate the capability of our method to ensure global structure local details high resolution and low computational cost simultaneously. More results and the code can be found on our project page at http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likun/projects/Joint2Human.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Joint2Human_High-Quality_3D_Human_Generation_via_Compact_Spherical_Embedding_of_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
"Prompt-Free Diffusion: Taking ""Text"" out of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models","Xu, Xingqian, Guo, Jiayi, Wang, Zhangyang, Huang, Gao, Essa, Irfan, Shi, Humphrey","Text-to-image (T2I) research has grown explosively in the past year owing to the large-scale pre-trained diffusion models and many emerging personalization and editing approaches. Yet one pain point persists: the text prompt engineering and searching high-quality text prompts for customized results is more art than science. Moreover as commonly argued: ""an image is worth a thousand words"" - the attempt to describe a desired image with texts often ends up being ambiguous and cannot comprehensively cover delicate visual details hence necessitating more additional controls from the visual domain. In this paper we take a bold step forward: taking ""Text"" out of a pretrained T2I diffusion model to reduce the burdensome prompt engineering efforts for users. Our proposed framework Prompt-Free Diffusion relies on only visual inputs to generate new images: it takes a reference image as ""context"" an optional image structural conditioning and an initial noise with absolutely no text prompt. The core architecture behind the scene is Semantic Context Encoder (SeeCoder) substituting the commonly used CLIP-based or LLM-based text encoder. The reusability of SeeCoder also makes it a convenient drop-in component: one can also pre-train a SeeCoder in one T2I model and reuse it for another. Through extensive experiments Prompt-Free Diffusion is experimentally found to (i) outperform prior exemplar-based image synthesis approaches; (ii) perform on par with state-of-the-art T2I models using prompts following the best practice; and (iii) be naturally extensible to other downstream applications such as anime figure generation and virtual try-on with promising quality. Our code and models will be open-sourced.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_Prompt-Free_Diffusion_Taking_Text_out_of_Text-to-Image_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Multi-agent Long-term 3D Human Pose Forecasting via Interaction-aware Trajectory Conditioning,"Jeong, Jaewoo, Park, Daehee, Yoon, Kuk-Jin",Human pose forecasting garners attention for its diverse applications. However challenges in modeling the multi-modal nature of human motion and intricate interactions among agents persist particularly with longer timescales and more agents. In this paper we propose an interaction-aware trajectory-conditioned long-term multi-agent human pose forecasting model utilizing a coarse-to-fine prediction approach: multi-modal global trajectories are initially forecasted followed by respective local pose forecasts conditioned on each mode. In doing so our Trajectory2Pose model introduces a graph-based agent-wise interaction module for a reciprocal forecast of local motion-conditioned global trajectory and trajectory-conditioned local pose. Our model effectively handles the multi-modality of human motion and the complexity of long-term multi-agent interactions improving performance in complex environments. Furthermore we address the lack of long-term (6s+) multi-agent (5+) datasets by constructing a new dataset from real-world images and 2D annotations enabling a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model. State-of-the-art prediction performance on both complex and simpler datasets confirms the generalized effectiveness of our method.

CLOAF: CoLlisiOn-Aware Human Flow,"Davydov, Andrey, Engilberge, Martin, Salzmann, Mathieu, Fua, Pascal",Even the best current algorithms for estimating body 3D shape and pose yield results that include body self-intersections. In this paper we present CLOAF which exploits the diffeomorphic nature of Ordinary Differential Equations to eliminate such self-intersections while still imposing body shape constraints. We show that unlike earlier approaches to addressing this issue ours completely eliminates the self-intersections without compromising the accuracy of the reconstructions. Being differentiable CLOAF can be used to fine-tune pose and shape estimation baselines to improve their overall performance and eliminate self-intersections in their predictions. Furthermore we demonstrate how our CLOAF strategy can be applied to practically any motion field induced by the user. CLOAF also makes it possible to edit motion to interact with the environment without worrying about potential collision or loss of body-shape prior.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Davydov_CLOAF_CoLlisiOn-Aware_Human_Flow_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Hybrid Functional Maps for Crease-Aware Non-Isometric Shape Matching,"Bastian, Lennart, Xie, Yizheng, Navab, Nassir, L√§hner, Zorah",Non-isometric shape correspondence remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Traditional methods using Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO) eigenmodes face limitations in characterizing high-frequency extrinsic shape changes like bending and creases. We propose a novel approach of combining the non-orthogonal extrinsic basis of eigenfunctions of the elastic thin-shell hessian with the intrinsic ones of the LBO creating a hybrid spectral space in which we construct functional maps. To this end we present a theoretical framework to effectively integrate non-orthogonal basis functions into descriptor- and learning-based functional map methods. Our approach can be incorporated easily into existing functional map pipelines across varying applications and is able to handle complex deformations beyond isometries. We show extensive evaluations across various supervised and unsupervised settings and demonstrate significant improvements. Notably our approach achieves up to 15% better mean geodesic error for non-isometric correspondence settings and up to 45% improvement in scenarios with topological noise.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bastian_Hybrid_Functional_Maps_for_Crease-Aware_Non-Isometric_Shape_Matching_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Density-Guided Semi-Supervised 3D Semantic Segmentation with Dual-Space Hardness Sampling,"Li, Jianan, Dong, Qiulei",Densely annotating the large-scale point clouds is laborious. To alleviate the annotation burden contrastive learning has attracted increasing attention for tackling semi-supervised 3D semantic segmentation. However existing point-to-point contrastive learning techniques in literature are generally sensitive to outliers resulting in insufficient modeling of the point-wise representations. To address this problem we propose a method named DDSemi for semi-supervised 3D semantic segmentation where a density-guided contrastive learning technique is explored. This technique calculates the contrastive loss in a point-to-anchor manner by estimating an anchor for each class from the memory bank based on the finding that the cluster centers tend to be located in dense regions. In this technique an inter-contrast loss is derived from the perturbed unlabeled point cloud pairs while an intra-contrast loss is derived from a single unlabeled point cloud. The derived losses could enhance the discriminability of the features and implicitly constrain the semantic consistency between the perturbed unlabeled point cloud pairs. In addition we propose a dual-space hardness sampling strategy to pay more attention to the hard samples located in sparse regions of both the geometric space and feature space by reweighting the point-wise intra-contrast loss. Experimental results on both indoor-scene and outdoor-scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the comparative state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_Density-Guided_Semi-Supervised_3D_Semantic_Segmentation_with_Dual-Space_Hardness_Sampling_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ElasticDiffusion: Training-free Arbitrary Size Image Generation through Global-Local Content Separation,"Haji-Ali, Moayed, Balakrishnan, Guha, Ordonez, Vicente",Diffusion models have revolutionized image generation in recent years yet they are still limited to a few sizes and aspect ratios. We propose ElasticDiffusion a novel training-free decoding method that enables pretrained text-to-image diffusion models to generate images with various sizes. ElasticDiffusion attempts to decouple the generation trajectory of a pretrained model into local and global signals. The local signal controls low-level pixel information and can be estimated on local patches while the global signal is used to maintain overall structural consistency and is estimated with a reference image. We test our method on CelebA-HQ (faces) and LAION-COCO (objects/indoor/outdoor scenes). Our experiments and qualitative results show superior image coherence quality across aspect ratios compared to MultiDiffusion and the standard decoding strategy of Stable Diffusion.

Locally Adaptive Neural 3D Morphable Models,"Tarasiou, Michail, Potamias, Rolandos Alexandros, O'Sullivan, Eimear, Ploumpis, Stylianos, Zafeiriou, Stefanos",We present the Locally Adaptive Morphable Model (LAMM) a highly flexible Auto-Encoder (AE) framework for learning to generate and manipulate 3D meshes. We train our architecture following a simple self-supervised training scheme in which input displacements over a set of sparse control vertices are used to overwrite the encoded geometry in order to transform one training sample into another. During inference our model produces a dense output that adheres locally to the specified sparse geometry while maintaining the overall appearance of the encoded object. This approach results in state-of-the-art performance in both disentangling manipulated geometry and 3D mesh reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge LAMM is the first end-to-end framework that enables direct local control of 3D vertex geometry in a single forward pass. A very efficient computational graph allows our network to train with only a fraction of the memory required by previous methods and run faster during inference generating 12k vertex meshes at >60fps on a single CPU thread. We further leverage local geometry control as a primitive for higher level editing operations and present a set of derivative capabilities such as swapping and sampling object parts.

ICON: Incremental CONfidence for Joint Pose and Radiance Field Optimization,"Wang, Weiyao, Gleize, Pierre, Tang, Hao, Chen, Xingyu, Liang, Kevin J, Feiszli, Matt","Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) exhibit remarkable performance for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) given a set of 2D images. However NeRF training requires accurate camera pose for each input view typically obtained by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Recent works have attempted to relax this constraint but they still often rely on decent initial poses which they can refine. Here we aim at removing the requirement for pose initialization. We present Incremental CONfidence (ICON) an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames. ICON only assumes smooth camera motion to estimate initial guess for poses. Further ICON introduces ""confidence"": an adaptive measure of model quality used to dynamically reweight gradients. ICON relies on high-confidence poses to learn NeRF and high-confidence 3D structure (as encoded by NeRF) to learn poses. We show that ICON without prior pose initialization achieves superior performance in both CO3D and HO3D versus methods which use SfM pose.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_ICON_Incremental_CONfidence_for_Joint_Pose_and_Radiance_Field_Optimization_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Learned Scanpaths Aid Blind Panoramic Video Quality Assessment,"Fan, Kanglong, Wen, Wen, Li, Mu, Peng, Yifan, Ma, Kede",Panoramic videos have the advantage of providing an immersive and interactive viewing experience. Nevertheless their spherical nature gives rise to various and uncertain user viewing behaviors which poses significant challenges for panoramic video quality assessment (PVQA). In this work we propose an end-to-end optimized blind PVQA method with explicit modeling of user viewing patterns through visual scanpaths. Our method consists of two modules: a scanpath generator and a quality assessor. The scanpath generator is initially trained to predict future scanpaths by minimizing their expected code length and then jointly optimized with the quality assessor for quality prediction. Our blind PVQA method enables direct quality assessment of panoramic images by treating them as videos composed of identical frames. Experiments on three public panoramic image and video quality datasets encompassing both synthetic and authentic distortions validate the superiority of our blind PVQA model over existing methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Fan_Learned_Scanpaths_Aid_Blind_Panoramic_Video_Quality_Assessment_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
TI2V-Zero: Zero-Shot Image Conditioning for Text-to-Video Diffusion Models,"Ni, Haomiao, Egger, Bernhard, Lohit, Suhas, Cherian, Anoop, Wang, Ye, Koike-Akino, Toshiaki, Huang, Sharon X., Marks, Tim K.","Text-conditioned image-to-video generation (TI2V) aims to synthesize a realistic video starting from a given image (e.g. a woman's photo) and a text description (e.g. ""a woman is drinking water.""). Existing TI2V frameworks often require costly training on video-text datasets and specific model designs for text and image conditioning. In this paper we propose TI2V-Zero a zero-shot tuning-free method that empowers a pretrained text-to-video (T2V) diffusion model to be conditioned on a provided image enabling TI2V generation without any optimization fine-tuning or introducing external modules. Our approach leverages a pretrained T2V diffusion foundation model as the generative prior. To guide video generation with the additional image input we propose a ""repeat-and-slide"" strategy that modulates the reverse denoising process allowing the frozen diffusion model to synthesize a video frame-by-frame starting from the provided image. To ensure temporal continuity we employ a DDPM inversion strategy to initialize Gaussian noise for each newly synthesized frame and a resampling technique to help preserve visual details. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both domain-specific and open-domain datasets where TI2V-Zero consistently outperforms a recent open-domain TI2V model. Furthermore we show that TI2V-Zero can seamlessly extend to other tasks such as video infilling and prediction when provided with more images. Its autoregressive design also supports long video generation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ni_TI2V-Zero_Zero-Shot_Image_Conditioning_for_Text-to-Video_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
iToF-flow-based High Frame Rate Depth Imaging,"Meng, Yu, Xue, Zhou, Chang, Xu, Hu, Xuemei, Yue, Tao",iToF is a prevalent cost-effective technology for 3D perception. While its reliance on multi-measurement commonly leads to reduced performance in dynamic environments. Based on the analysis of the physical iToF imaging process we propose the iToF flow composed of crossmode transformation and uni-mode photometric correction to model the variation of measurements caused by different measurement modes and 3D motion respectively. We propose a local linear transform (LLT) based cross-mode transfer module (LCTM) for mode-varying and pixel shift compensation of cross-mode flow and uni-mode photometric correct module (UPCM) for estimating the depth-wise motion caused photometric residual of uni-mode flow. The iToF flow-based depth extraction network is proposed which could facilitate the estimation of the 4-phase measurements at each individual time for high framerate and accurate depth estimation. Extensive experiments including both simulation and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Compared with the SOTA method our approach reduces the computation time by 75% while improving the performance by 38%.

Relightful Harmonization: Lighting-aware Portrait Background Replacement,"Ren, Mengwei, Xiong, Wei, Yoon, Jae Shin, Shu, Zhixin, Zhang, Jianming, Jung, HyunJoon, Gerig, Guido, Zhang, He",Portrait harmonization aims to composite a subject into a new background adjusting its lighting and color to ensure harmony with the background scene. Existing harmonization techniques often only focus on adjusting the global color and brightness of the foreground and ignore crucial illumination cues from the background such as apparent lighting direction leading to unrealistic compositions. We introduce Relightful Harmonization a lighting-aware diffusion model designed to seamlessly harmonize sophisticated lighting effect for the foreground portrait using any background image. Our approach unfolds in three stages. First we introduce a lighting representation module that allows our diffusion model to encode lighting information from target image background. Second we introduce an alignment network that aligns lighting features learned from image background with lighting features learned from panorama environment maps which is a complete representation for scene illumination. Last to further boost the photorealism of the proposed method we introduce a novel data simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training pairs from a diverse range of natural images which are used to refine the model. Our method outperforms existing benchmarks in visual fidelity and lighting coherence showing superior generalization in real-world testing scenarios highlighting its versatility and practicality.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ren_Relightful_Harmonization_Lighting-aware_Portrait_Background_Replacement_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Mitigating Motion Blur in Neural Radiance Fields with Events and Frames,"Cannici, Marco, Scaramuzza, Davide",Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown great potential in novel view synthesis. However they struggle to render sharp images when the data used for training is affected by motion blur. On the other hand event cameras excel in dynamic scenes as they measure brightness changes with microsecond resolution and are thus only marginally affected by blur. Recent methods attempt to enhance NeRF reconstructions under camera motion by fusing frames and events. However they face challenges in recovering accurate color content or constrain the NeRF to a set of predefined camera poses harming reconstruction quality in challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel formulation addressing these issues by leveraging both model- and learning-based modules. We explicitly model the blur formation process exploiting the event double integral as an additional model-based prior. Additionally we model the event-pixel response using an end-to-end learnable response function allowing our method to adapt to non-idealities in the real event-camera sensor. We show on synthetic and real data that the proposed approach outperforms existing deblur NeRFs that use only frames as well as those that combine frames and events by +6.13dB and +2.48dB respectively.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cannici_Mitigating_Motion_Blur_in_Neural_Radiance_Fields_with_Events_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
TokenHMR: Advancing Human Mesh Recovery with a Tokenized Pose Representation,"Dwivedi, Sai Kumar, Sun, Yu, Patel, Priyanka, Feng, Yao, Black, Michael J.","We address the problem of regressing 3D human pose and shape from a single image with a focus on 3D accuracy. The current best methods leverage large datasets of 3D pseudo-ground-truth (p-GT) and 2D keypoints leading to robust performance. With such methods however we observe a paradoxical decline in 3D pose accuracy with increasing 2D accuracy. This is caused by biases in the p-GT and the use of an approximate camera projection model. We quantify the error induced by current camera models and show that fitting 2D keypoints and p-GT accurately causes incorrect 3D poses. Our analysis defines the invalid distances within which minimizing 2D and p-GT losses is detrimental. We use this to formulate a new loss ""Threshold-Adaptive Loss Scaling"" (TALS) that penalizes gross 2D and p-GT errors but not smaller ones. With such a loss there are many 3D poses that could equally explain the 2D evidence. To reduce this ambiguity we need a prior over valid human poses but such priors can introduce unwanted bias. To address this we exploit a tokenized representation of human pose and reformulate the problem as token prediction. This restricts the estimated poses to the space of valid poses effectively improving robustness to occlusion. Extensive experiments on the EMDB and 3DPW datasets show that our reformulated loss and tokenization allows us to train on in-the-wild data while improving 3D accuracy over the state-of-the-art.

FaceCom: Towards High-fidelity 3D Facial Shape Completion via Optimization and Inpainting Guidance,"Li, Yinglong, Wu, Hongyu, Wang, Xiaogang, Qin, Qingzhao, Zhao, Yijiao, Wang, Yong, Hao, Aimin",We propose FaceCom a method for 3D facial shape completion which delivers high-fidelity results for incomplete facial inputs of arbitrary forms. Unlike end-to-end shape completion methods based on point clouds or voxels our approach relies on a mesh-based generative network that is easy to optimize enabling it to handle shape completion for irregular facial scans. We first train a shape generator on a mixed 3D facial dataset containing 2405 identities. Based on the incomplete facial input we fit complete faces using an optimization approach under image inpainting guidance. The completion results are refined through a post-processing step. FaceCom demonstrates the ability to effectively and naturally complete facial scan data with varying missing regions and degrees of missing areas. Our method can be used in medical prosthetic fabrication and the registration of deficient scanning data.

LightOctree: Lightweight 3D Spatially-Coherent Indoor Lighting Estimation,"Wang, Xuecan, Xiao, Shibang, Liang, Xiaohui",We present a lightweight solution for estimating spatially-coherent indoor lighting from a single RGB image. Previous methods for estimating illumination using volumetric representations have overlooked the sparse distribution of light sources in space necessitating substantial memory and computational resources for achieving high-quality results. We introduce a unified voxel octree-based illumination estimation framework to produce 3D spatially-coherent lighting. Additionally a differentiable voxel octree cone tracing rendering layer is proposed to eliminate regular volumetric representation throughout the entire process and ensure the retention of features across different frequency domains. This reduction significantly decreases spatial usage and required floating-point operations without substantially compromising precision. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality coherent estimation with minimal cost compared to previous methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_LightOctree_Lightweight_3D_Spatially-Coherent_Indoor_Lighting_Estimation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FaceLift: Semi-supervised 3D Facial Landmark Localization,"Ferman, David, Garrido, Pablo, Bharaj, Gaurav",3D facial landmark localization has proven to be of particular use for applications such as face tracking 3D face modeling and image-based 3D face reconstruction. In the supervised learning case such methods usually rely on 3D landmark datasets derived from 3DMM-based registration that often lack spatial definition alignment as compared with that chosen by hand-labeled human consensus e.g. how are eyebrow landmarks defined? This creates a gap between landmark datasets generated via high-quality 2D human labels and 3DMMs and it ultimately limits their effectiveness. To address this issue we introduce a novel semi-supervised learning approach that learns 3D landmarks by directly lifting (visible) hand-labeled 2D landmarks and ensures better definition alignment without the need for 3D landmark datasets. To lift 2D landmarks to 3D we leverage 3D-aware GANs for better multi-view consistency learning and in-the-wild multi-frame videos for robust cross-generalization. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves better definition alignment between 2D-3D landmarks but also outperforms other supervised learning 3D landmark localization methods on both 3DMM labeled and photogrammetric ground truth evaluation datasets.

PSDPM: Prototype-based Secondary Discriminative Pixels Mining for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Zhao, Xinqiao, Yang, Ziqian, Dai, Tianhong, Zhang, Bingfeng, Xiao, Jimin",Image-level Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) has received increasing attention due to its low annotation cost. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) generated through classifier weights in WSSS inevitably ignores certain useful cues while the CAM generated through class prototypes can alleviate that. However because of the different goals of image classification and semantic segmentation the class prototypes still focus on activating primary discriminative pixels learned from classification loss leading to incomplete CAM. In this paper we propose a plugand-play Prototype-based Secondary Discriminative Pixels Mining (PSDPM) framework for enabling class prototypes to activate more secondary discriminative pixels thus generating a more complete CAM. Specifically we introduce a Foreground Pixel Estimation Module (FPEM) for estimating potential foreground pixels based on the correlations between primary and secondary discriminative pixels and the semantic segmentation results of baseline methods. Then we enable WSSS model to learn discriminative features from secondary discriminative pixels through a consistency loss calculated between FPEM result and class-prototype CAM. Experimental results show that our PSDPM improves various baseline methods significantly and achieves new state-of-the-art performances on WSSS benchmarks.

Frozen CLIP: A Strong Backbone for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Zhang, Bingfeng, Yu, Siyue, Wei, Yunchao, Zhao, Yao, Xiao, Jimin",Weakly supervised semantic segmentation has witnessed great achievements with image-level labels. Several recent approaches use the CLIP model to generate pseudo labels for training an individual segmentation model while there is no attempt to apply the CLIP model as the backbone to directly segment objects with image-level labels. In this paper we propose WeCLIP a CLIP-based single-stage pipeline for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. Specifically the frozen CLIP model is applied as the backbone for semantic feature extraction and a new decoder is designed to interpret extracted semantic features for final prediction. Meanwhile we utilize the above frozen backbone to generate pseudo labels for training the decoder. Such labels cannot be optimized during training. We then propose a refinement module (RFM) to rectify them dynamically. Our architecture enforces the proposed decoder and RFM to benefit from each other to boost the final performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms other approaches with less training cost. Additionally our WeCLIP also obtains promising results for fully supervised settings.

LAFS: Landmark-based Facial Self-supervised Learning for Face Recognition,"Sun, Zhonglin, Feng, Chen, Patras, Ioannis, Tzimiropoulos, Georgios",In this work we focus on learning facial representations that can be adapted to train effective face recognition models particularly in the absence of labels. Firstly compared with existing labelled face datasets a vastly larger magnitude of unlabeled faces exists in the real world. We explore the learning strategy of these unlabeled facial images through self-supervised pretraining to transfer generalized face recognition performance. Moreover motivated by one recent finding that is the face saliency area is critical for face recognition in contrast to utilizing random cropped blocks of images for constructing augmentations in pretraining we utilize patches localized by extracted facial landmarks. This enables our method - namely Landmark-based Facial Self-supervised learning (LAFS) to learn key representation that is more critical for face recognition. We also incorporate two landmark-specific augmentations which introduce more diversity of landmark information to further regularize the learning. With learned landmark-based facial representations we further adapt the representation for face recognition with regularization mitigating variations in landmark positions. Our method achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art on multiple face recognition benchmarks especially on more challenging few-shot scenarios.

SED: A Simple Encoder-Decoder for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation,"Xie, Bin, Cao, Jiale, Xie, Jin, Khan, Fahad Shahbaz, Pang, Yanwei",Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation strives to distinguish pixels into different semantic groups from an open set of categories. Most existing methods explore utilizing pre-trained vision-language models in which the key is to adopt the image-level model for pixel-level segmentation task. In this paper we propose a simple encoder-decoder named SED for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation which comprises a hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation and a gradual fusion decoder with category early rejection. The hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation employs hierarchical backbone instead of plain transformer to predict pixel-level image-text cost map. Compared to plain transformer hierarchical backbone better captures local spatial information and has linear computational complexity with respect to input size. Our gradual fusion decoder employs a top-down structure to combine cost map and the feature maps of different backbone levels for segmentation. To accelerate inference speed we introduce a category early rejection scheme in the decoder that rejects many no-existing categories at the early layer of decoder resulting in at most 4.7 times acceleration without accuracy degradation. Experiments are performed on multiple open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets which demonstrates the efficacy of our SED method. When using ConvNeXt-B our SED method achieves mIoU score of 31.6% on ADE20K with 150 categories at 82 millisecond (ms) per image on a single A6000.

GPLD3D: Latent Diffusion of 3D Shape Generative Models by Enforcing Geometric and Physical Priors,"Dong, Yuan, Zuo, Qi, Gu, Xiaodong, Yuan, Weihao, Zhao, Zhengyi, Dong, Zilong, Bo, Liefeng, Huang, Qixing",State-of-the-art man-made shape generative models usually adopt established generative models under a suitable implicit shape representation. A common theme is to perform distribution alignment which does not explicitly model important shape priors. As a result many synthetic shapes are not connected. Other synthetic shapes present problems of physical stability and geometric feasibility. This paper introduces a novel latent diffusion shape-generative model regularized by a quality checker that outputs a score of a latent code. The scoring function employs a learned function that provides a geometric feasibility score and a deterministic procedure to quantify a physical stability score. The key to our approach is a new diffusion procedure that combines the discrete empirical data distribution and a continuous distribution induced by the quality checker. We introduce a principled approach to determine the tradeoff parameters for learning the denoising network at different noise levels. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art shape generations quantitatively and qualitatively on ShapeNet-v2.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Dong_GPLD3D_Latent_Diffusion_of_3D_Shape_Generative_Models_by_Enforcing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion Models,"Wu, Tsung-Han, Lian, Long, Gonzalez, Joseph E., Li, Boyi, Darrell, Trevor",Text-to-image generation has witnessed significant progress with the advent of diffusion models. Despite the ability to generate photorealistic images current text-to-image diffusion models still often struggle to accurately interpret and follow complex input text prompts. In contrast to existing models that aim to generate images only with their best effort we introduce Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD). SLD is a framework that generates an image from the input prompt assesses its alignment with the prompt and performs self-corrections on the inaccuracies in the generated image. Steered by an LLM controller SLD turns text-to-image generation into an iterative closed-loop process ensuring correctness in the resulting image. SLD is not only training-free but can also be seamlessly integrated with diffusion models behind API access such as DALL-E 3 to further boost the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models. Experimental results show that our approach can rectify a majority of incorrect generations particularly in generative numeracy attribute binding and spatial relationships. Furthermore by simply adjusting the instructions to the LLM SLD can perform image editing tasks bridging the gap between text-to-image generation and image editing pipelines. Our code is available at: https://self-correcting-llm-diffusion.github.io.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wu_Self-correcting_LLM-controlled_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PACER+: On-Demand Pedestrian Animation Controller in Driving Scenarios,"Wang, Jingbo, Luo, Zhengyi, Yuan, Ye, Li, Yixuan, Dai, Bo",We address the challenge of content diversity and controllability in pedestrian simulation for driving scenarios. Recent pedestrian animation frameworks have a significant limitation wherein they primarily focus on either following trajectory or the content of the reference video consequently overlooking the potential diversity of human motion within such scenarios. This limitation restricts the ability to generate pedestrian behaviors that exhibit a wider range of variations and realistic motions and therefore restricts its usage to provide rich motion content for other components in the driving simulation system e.g. suddenly changed motion to which the autonomous vehicle should respond. In our approach we strive to surpass the limitation by showcasing diverse human motions obtained from various sources such as generated human motions in addition to following the given trajectory. The fundamental contribution of our framework lies in combining the motion tracking task with trajectory following which enables the tracking of specific motion parts (e.g. upper body) while simultaneously following the given trajectory by a single policy. This way we significantly enhance both the diversity of simulated human motion within the given scenario and the controllability of the content including language-based control. Our framework facilitates the generation of a wide range of human motions contributing to greater realism and adaptability in pedestrian simulations for driving scenarios.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_PACER_On-Demand_Pedestrian_Animation_Controller_in_Driving_Scenarios_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
LTM: Lightweight Textured Mesh Extraction and Refinement of Large Unbounded Scenes for Efficient Storage and Real-time Rendering,"Choi, Jaehoon, Shah, Rajvi, Li, Qinbo, Wang, Yipeng, Saraf, Ayush, Kim, Changil, Huang, Jia-Bin, Manocha, Dinesh, Alsisan, Suhib, Kopf, Johannes",Advancements in neural signed distance fields (SDFs) have enabled modeling 3D surface geometry from a set of 2D images of real-world scenes. Baking neural SDFs can extract explicit mesh with appearance baked into texture maps as neural features. The baked meshes still have a large memory footprint and require a powerful GPU for real-time rendering. Neural optimization of such large meshes with differentiable rendering pose significant challenges. We propose a method to produce optimized meshes for large unbounded scenes with low triangle budget and high fidelity of geometry and appearance. We achieve this by combining advancements in baking neural SDFs with classical mesh simplification techniques and proposing a joint appearance-geometry refinement step. The visual quality is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art neural meshing and baking methods with high geometric accuracy despite significant reduction in triangle count making the produced meshes efficient for storage transmission and rendering on mobile hardware. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on large unbounded scenes from mip-NeRF 360 Tanks & Temples and Deep Blending datasets achieving at-par rendering quality with 73x reduced triangles and 11x reduction in memory footprint.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Choi_LTM_Lightweight_Textured_Mesh_Extraction_and_Refinement_of_Large_Unbounded_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Don't Drop Your Samples! Coherence-Aware Training Benefits Conditional Diffusion,"Dufour, Nicolas, Besnier, Victor, Kalogeiton, Vicky, Picard, David",Conditional diffusion models are powerful generative models that can leverage various types of conditional information such as class labels segmentation masks or text captions. However in many real-world scenarios conditional information may be noisy or unreliable due to human annotation errors or weak alignment. In this paper we propose the Coherence-Aware Diffusion (CAD) a novel method to integrate confidence in conditional information into diffusion models allowing them to learn from noisy annotations without discarding data. We assume that each data point has an associated confidence score that reflects the quality of the conditional information. We then condition the diffusion model on both the conditional information and the confidence score. In this way the model learns to ignore or discount the conditioning when the confidence is low. We show that our method is theoretically sound and empirically effective on various conditional generation tasks. Moreover we show that leveraging confidence generates realistic and diverse samples that respect conditional information better than models trained on cleaned datasets where samples with low confidence have been discarded.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Dufour_Dont_Drop_Your_Samples_Coherence-Aware_Training_Benefits_Conditional_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
What Do You See in Vehicle? Comprehensive Vision Solution for In-Vehicle Gaze Estimation,"Cheng, Yihua, Zhu, Yaning, Wang, Zongji, Hao, Hongquan, Liu, Yongwei, Cheng, Shiqing, Wang, Xi, Chang, Hyung Jin",Driver's eye gaze holds a wealth of cognitive and intentional cues crucial for intelligent vehicles. Despite its significance research on in-vehicle gaze estimation remains limited due to the scarcity of comprehensive and well-annotated datasets in real driving scenarios. In this paper we present three novel elements to advance in-vehicle gaze research. Firstly we introduce IVGaze a pioneering dataset capturing in-vehicle gaze collected from 125 individuals and covering a large range of gaze and head within vehicles. Conventional gaze collection systems are inadequate for in-vehicle use. In this dataset we propose a new vision-based solution for in-vehicle gaze collection introducing a refined gaze target calibration method to tackle annotation challenges. Second our research focuses on in-vehicle gaze estimation leveraging the IVGaze. Images of in-vehicle faces often suffer from low resolution prompting our introduction of a gaze pyramid transformer that harnesses transformer-based multilevel features integration. Expanding upon this we introduce the dual-stream gaze pyramid transformer (GazeDPTR). Employing perspective transformation we rotate virtual cameras to normalize images utilizing camera pose to merge normalized and original images for accurate gaze estimation. GazeDPTR showcases state-of-the-art performance on the IVGaze dataset. Thirdly we explore a novel strategy for gaze zone classification by extending the GazeDPTR. A foundational tri-plane and project gaze onto these planes are newly defined. Leveraging both positional features from the projection points and visual attributes from images we achieve superior performance compared to relying solely on visual features thereby substantiating the advantage of gaze estimation.

UFORecon: Generalizable Sparse-View Surface Reconstruction from Arbitrary and Unfavorable Sets,"Na, Youngju, Kim, Woo Jae, Han, Kyu Beom, Ha, Suhyeon, Yoon, Sung-Eui",Generalizable neural implicit surface reconstruction aims to obtain an accurate underlying geometry given a limited number of multi-view images from unseen scenes. However existing methods select only informative and relevant views using predefined scores for training and testing phases. This constraint renders the model impractical in real-world scenarios where the availability of favorable combinations cannot always be ensured. We introduce and validate a view-combination score to indicate the effectiveness of the input view combination. We observe that previous methods output degenerate solutions under arbitrary and unfavorable sets. Building upon this finding we propose UFORecon a robust view-combination generalizable surface reconstruction framework. To achieve this we apply cross-view matching transformers to model interactions between source images and build correlation frustums to capture global correlations. Additionally we explicitly encode pairwise feature similarities as view-consistent priors. Our proposed framework significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of view-combination generalizability and also in the conventional generalizable protocol trained with favorable view-combinations.

Breathing Life Into Sketches Using Text-to-Video Priors,"Gal, Rinon, Vinker, Yael, Alaluf, Yuval, Bermano, Amit, Cohen-Or, Daniel, Shamir, Ariel, Chechik, Gal","A sketch is one of the most intuitive and versatile tools humans use to convey their ideas visually. An animated sketch opens another dimension to the expression of ideas and is widely used by designers for a variety of purposes. Animating sketches is a laborious process requiring extensive experience and professional design skills. In this work we present a method that automatically adds motion to a single-subject sketch (hence ""breathing life into it"") merely by providing a text prompt indicating the desired motion. The output is a short animation provided in vector representation which can be easily edited. Our method does not require extensive training but instead leverages the motion prior of a large pretrained text-to-video diffusion model using a score-distillation loss to guide the placement of strokes. To promote natural and smooth motion and to better preserve the sketch's appearance we model the learned motion through two components. The first governs small local deformations and the second controls global affine transformations. Surprisingly we find that even models that struggle to generate sketch videos on their own can still serve as a useful backbone for animating abstract representations.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Gal_Breathing_Life_Into_Sketches_Using_Text-to-Video_Priors_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Learning Diffusion Texture Priors for Image Restoration,"Ye, Tian, Chen, Sixiang, Chai, Wenhao, Xing, Zhaohu, Qin, Jing, Lin, Ge, Zhu, Lei",Diffusion Models have shown remarkable performance in image generation tasks which are capable of generating diverse and realistic image content. When adopting diffusion models for image restoration the crucial challenge lies in how to preserve high-level image fidelity in the randomness diffusion process and generate accurate background structures and realistic texture details. In this paper we propose a general framework and develop a Diffusion Texture Prior Model (DTPM) for image restoration tasks. DTPM explicitly models high-quality texture details through the diffusion process rather than global contextual content. In phase one of the training stage we pre-train DTPM on approximately 55K high-quality image samples after which we freeze most of its parameters. In phase two we insert conditional guidance adapters into DTPM and equip it with an initial predictor thereby facilitating its rapid adaptation to downstream image restoration tasks. Our DTPM could mitigate the randomness of traditional diffusion models by utilizing encapsulated rich and diverse texture knowledge and background structural information provided by the initial predictor during the sampling process. Our comprehensive evaluations of five image restoration tasks demonstrate DTPM's superiority over existing regression and diffusion-based image restoration methods in perceptual quality and its exceptional generalization capabilities.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ye_Learning_Diffusion_Texture_Priors_for_Image_Restoration_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Entangled View-Epipolar Information Aggregation for Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields,"Min, Zhiyuan, Luo, Yawei, Yang, Wei, Wang, Yuesong, Yang, Yi",Generalizable NeRF can directly synthesize novel views across new scenes eliminating the need for scene-specific retraining in vanilla NeRF. A critical enabling factor in these approaches is the extraction of a generalizable 3D representation by aggregating source-view features. In this paper we propose an Entangled View-Epipolar Information Aggregation method dubbed EVE-NeRF. Different from existing methods that consider cross-view and along-epipolar information independently EVE-NeRF conducts the view-epipolar feature aggregation in an entangled manner by injecting the scene-invariant appearance continuity and geometry consistency priors to the aggregation process. Our approach effectively mitigates the potential lack of inherent geometric and appearance constraint resulting from one-dimensional interactions thus further boosting the 3D representation generalizablity. EVE-NeRF attains state-of-the-art performance across various evaluation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstate that compared to prevailing single-dimensional aggregation the entangled network excels in the accuracy of 3D scene geometry and appearance reconstruction.

YolOOD: Utilizing Object Detection Concepts for Multi-Label Out-of-Distribution Detection,"Zolfi, Alon, Amit, Guy, Baras, Amit, Koda, Satoru, Morikawa, Ikuya, Elovici, Yuval, Shabtai, Asaf",Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has attracted a large amount of attention from the machine learning research community in recent years due to its importance in deployed systems. Most of the previous studies focused on the detection of OOD samples in the multi-class classification task. However OOD detection in the multi-label classification task a more common real-world use case remains an underexplored domain. In this research we propose YolOOD - a method that utilizes concepts from the object detection domain to perform OOD detection in the multi-label classification task. Object detection models have an inherent ability to distinguish between objects of interest (in-distribution data) and irrelevant objects (OOD data) in images that contain multiple objects belonging to different class categories. These abilities allow us to convert a regular object detection model into an image classifier with inherent OOD detection capabilities with just minor changes. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art OOD detection methods and demonstrate YolOOD's ability to outperform these methods on a comprehensive suite of in-distribution and OOD benchmark datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zolfi_YolOOD_Utilizing_Object_Detection_Concepts_for_Multi-Label_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Collaborating Foundation Models for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation,"Benigmim, Yasser, Roy, Subhankar, Essid, Slim, Kalogeiton, Vicky, Lathuili√®re, St√©phane",Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) deals with training a model on a labeled source domain with the aim of generalizing to unseen domains during inference. Existing DGSS methods typically effectuate robust features by means of Domain Randomization (DR). Such an approach is often limited as it can only account for style diversification and not content. In this work we take an orthogonal approach to DGSS and propose to use an assembly of CoLlaborative FOUndation models for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (CLOUDS). In detail CLOUDS is a framework that integrates Foundation Models of various kinds: (i) CLIP backbone for its robust feature representation (ii) Diffusion Model to diversify the content thereby covering various modes of the possible target distribution and (iii) Segment Anything Model (SAM) for iteratively refining the predictions of the segmentation model. Extensive experiments show that our CLOUDS excels in adapting from synthetic to real DGSS benchmarks and under varying weather conditions notably outperforming prior methods by 5.6% and 6.7% on averaged mIoU respectively.

Towards Variable and Coordinated Holistic Co-Speech Motion Generation,"Liu, Yifei, Cao, Qiong, Wen, Yandong, Jiang, Huaiguang, Ding, Changxing",This paper addresses the problem of generating lifelike holistic co-speech motions for 3D avatars focusing on two key aspects: variability and coordination. Variability allows the avatar to exhibit a wide range of motions even with similar speech content while coordination ensures a harmonious alignment among facial expressions hand gestures and body poses. We aim to achieve both with ProbTalk a unified probabilistic framework designed to jointly model facial hand and body movements in speech. ProbTalk builds on the variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture and incorporates three core designs. First we introduce product quantization (PQ) to the VAE which enriches the representation of complex holistic motion. Second we devise a novel non-autoregressive model that embeds 2D positional encoding into the product-quantized representation thereby preserving essential structure information of the PQ codes. Last we employ a secondary stage to refine the preliminary prediction further sharpening the high-frequency details. Coupling these three designs enables ProbTalk to generate natural and diverse holistic co-speech motions outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations particularly in terms of realism. Our code and model will be released for research purposes at https://feifeifeiliu.github.io/probtalk/.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Towards_Variable_and_Coordinated_Holistic_Co-Speech_Motion_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AllSpark: Reborn Labeled Features from Unlabeled in Transformer for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Wang, Haonan, Zhang, Qixiang, Li, Yi, Li, Xiaomeng",Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has been proposed to alleviate the burden of time-consuming pixel-level manual labeling which leverages limited labeled data along with larger amounts of unlabeled data. Current state-of-the-art methods train the labeled data with ground truths and unlabeled data with pseudo labels. However the two training flows are separate which allows labeled data to dominate the training process resulting in low-quality pseudo labels and consequently sub-optimal results. To alleviate this issue we present AllSpark which reborns the labeled features from unlabeled ones with the channel-wise cross-attention mechanism. We further introduce a Semantic Memory along with a Channel Semantic Grouping strategy to ensure that unlabeled features adequately represent labeled features. The AllSpark shed new light on the architecture level designs of SSSS rather than framework level which avoids increasingly complicated training pipeline designs. It can also be regarded as a flexible bottleneck module that can be seamlessly integrated into a general transformer-based segmentation model. The proposed AllSpark outperforms existing methods across all evaluation protocols on Pascal Cityscapes and COCO benchmarks without bells-and-whistles.

SIGNeRF: Scene Integrated Generation for Neural Radiance Fields,"Dihlmann, Jan-Niklas, Engelhardt, Andreas, Lensch, Hendrik",Advances in image diffusion models have recently led to notable improvements in the generation of high-quality images. In combination with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) they enabled new opportunities in 3D generation. However most generative 3D approaches are object-centric and applying them to editing existing photorealistic scenes is not trivial. We propose SIGNeRF a novel approach for fast and controllable NeRF scene editing and scene-integrated object generation. A new generative update strategy ensures 3D consistency across the edited images without requiring iterative optimization. We find that depth-conditioned diffusion models inherently possess the capability to generate 3D consistent views by requesting a grid of images instead of single views. Based on these insights we introduce a multi-view reference sheet of modified images. Our method updates an image collection consistently based on the reference sheet and refines the original NeRF with the newly generated image set in one go. By exploiting the depth conditioning mechanism of the image diffusion model we gain fine control over the spatial location of the edit and enforce shape guidance by a selected region or an external mesh.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Dihlmann_SIGNeRF_Scene_Integrated_Generation_for_Neural_Radiance_Fields_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Generating Illustrated Instructions,"Menon, Sachit, Misra, Ishan, Girdhar, Rohit","We introduce a new task of generating ""Illustrated Instructions"" i.e. visual instructions customized to a user's needs. We identify desiderata unique to this task and formalize it through a suite of automatic and human evaluation metrics designed to measure the validity consistency and efficacy of the generations. We combine the power of large language models (LLMs) together with strong text-to-image generation diffusion models to propose a simple approach called StackedDiffusion which generates such illustrated instructions given text as input. The resulting model strongly outperforms baseline approaches and state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs; and in 30% of cases users even prefer it to human-generated articles. Most notably it enables various new and exciting applications far beyond what static articles on the web can provide such as personalized instructions complete with intermediate steps and pictures in response to a user's individual situation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Menon_Generating_Illustrated_Instructions_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Robust Image Denoising through Adversarial Frequency Mixup,"Ryou, Donghun, Ha, Inju, Yoo, Hyewon, Kim, Dongwan, Han, Bohyung",Image denoising approaches based on deep neural networks often struggle with overfitting to specific noise distributions present in training data. This challenge persists in existing real-world denoising networks which are trained using a limited spectrum of real noise distributions and thus show poor robustness to out-of-distribution real noise types. To alleviate this issue we develop a novel training framework called Adversarial Frequency Mixup (AFM). AFM leverages mixup in the frequency domain to generate noisy images with distinctive and challenging noise characteristics all the while preserving the properties of authentic real-world noise. Subsequently incorporating these noisy images into the training pipeline enhances the denoising network's robustness to variations in noise distributions. Extensive experiments and analyses conducted on a wide range of real noise benchmarks demonstrate that denoising networks trained with our proposed framework exhibit significant improvements in robustness to unseen noise distributions. The code is available at https://github.com/dhryougit/AFM.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ryou_Robust_Image_Denoising_through_Adversarial_Frequency_Mixup_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AnyScene: Customized Image Synthesis with Composited Foreground,"Chen, Ruidong, Wang, Lanjun, Nie, Weizhi, Zhang, Yongdong, Liu, An-An",Recent advancements in text-to-image technology have significantly advanced the field of image customization. Among various applications the task of customizing diverse scenes for user-specified composited elements holds great application value but has not been extensively explored. Addressing this gap we propose AnyScene a specialized framework designed to create varied scenes from composited foreground using textual prompts. AnyScene addresses the primary challenges inherent in existing methods particularly scene disharmony due to a lack of foreground semantic understanding and distortion of foreground elements. Specifically we develop a foreground injection module that guides a pre-trained diffusion model to generate cohesive scenes in visual harmony with the provided foreground. To enhance robust generation we implement a layout control strategy that prevents distortions of foreground elements. Furthermore an efficient image blending mechanism seamlessly reintegrates foreground details into the generated scenes producing outputs with overall visual harmony and precise foreground details. In addition we propose a new benchmark and a series of quantitative metrics to evaluate this proposed image customization task. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AnyScene which confirms its potential in various applications.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_AnyScene_Customized_Image_Synthesis_with_Composited_Foreground_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Training Generative Image Super-Resolution Models by Wavelet-Domain Losses Enables Better Control of Artifacts,"Korkmaz, Cansu, Tekalp, A. Murat, Dogan, Zafer","Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem where the size of the set of feasible solutions that are consistent with a given low-resolution image is very large. Many algorithms have been proposed to find a ""good"" solution among the feasible solutions that strike a balance between fidelity and perceptual quality. Unfortunately all known methods generate artifacts and hallucinations while trying to reconstruct high-frequency (HF) image details. A fundamental question is: Can a model learn to distinguish genuine image details from artifacts? Although some recent works focused on the differentiation of details and artifacts this is a very challenging problem and a satisfactory solution is yet to be found. This paper shows that the characterization of genuine HF details versus artifacts can be better learned by training GAN-based SR models using wavelet-domain loss functions compared to RGB-domain or Fourier-space losses. Although wavelet-domain losses have been used in the literature before they have not been used in the context of the SR task. More specifically we train the discriminator only on the HF wavelet sub-bands instead of on RGB images and the generator is trained by a fidelity loss over wavelet subbands to make it sensitive to the scale and orientation of structures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better perception-distortion trade-off according to multiple objective measures and visual evaluations.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Korkmaz_Training_Generative_Image_Super-Resolution_Models_by_Wavelet-Domain_Losses_Enables_Better_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Monocular Identity-Conditioned Facial Reflectance Reconstruction,"Ren, Xingyu, Deng, Jiankang, Cheng, Yuhao, Guo, Jia, Ma, Chao, Yan, Yichao, Zhu, Wenhan, Yang, Xiaokang",Recent 3D face reconstruction methods have made remarkable advancements yet there remain huge challenges in monocular high-quality facial reflectance reconstruction. Existing methods rely on a large amount of light-stage captured data to learn facial reflectance models. However the lack of subject diversity poses challenges in achieving good generalization and widespread applicability. In this paper we learn the reflectance prior in image space rather than UV space and present a framework named ID2Reflectance. Our framework can directly estimate the reflectance maps of a single image while using limited reflectance data for training. Our key insight is that reflectance data shares facial structures with RGB faces which enables obtaining expressive facial prior from inexpensive RGB data thus reducing the dependency on reflectance data. We first learn a high-quality prior for facial reflectance. Specifically we pretrain multi-domain facial feature codebooks and design a codebook fusion method to align the reflectance and RGB domains. Then we propose an identity-conditioned swapping module that injects facial identity from the target image into the pre-trained auto-encoder to modify the identity of the source reflectance image. Finally we stitch multi-view swapped reflectance images to obtain renderable assets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits excellent generalization capability and achieves state-of-the-art facial reflectance reconstruction results for in-the-wild faces.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ren_Monocular_Identity-Conditioned_Facial_Reflectance_Reconstruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
C3: High-Performance and Low-Complexity Neural Compression from a Single Image or Video,"Kim, Hyunjik, Bauer, Matthias, Theis, Lucas, Schwarz, Jonathan Richard, Dupont, Emilien",Most neural compression models are trained on large datasets of images or videos in order to generalize to unseen data. Such generalization typically requires large and expressive architectures with a high decoding complexity. Here we introduce C3 a neural compression method with strong rate-distortion (RD) performance that instead overfits a small model to each image or video separately. The resulting decoding complexity of C3 can be an order of magnitude lower than neural baselines with similar RD performance. C3 builds on COOL-CHIC [Ladune et al 2023] and makes several simple and effective improvements for images. We further develop new methodology to apply C3 to videos. On the CLIC2020 image benchmark we match the RD performance of VTM the reference implementation of the H.266 codec with less than3k MACs/pixel for decoding. On the UVG video benchmark we match the RD performance of the Video Compression Transformer [Mentzer er al 2022] a well-established neural video codec with less than 5k MACs/pixel for decoding.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kim_C3_High-Performance_and_Low-Complexity_Neural_Compression_from_a_Single_Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Revisiting Non-Autoregressive Transformers for Efficient Image Synthesis,"Ni, Zanlin, Wang, Yulin, Zhou, Renping, Guo, Jiayi, Hu, Jinyi, Liu, Zhiyuan, Song, Shiji, Yao, Yuan, Huang, Gao",The field of image synthesis is currently flourishing due to the advancements in diffusion models. While diffusion models have been successful their computational intensity has prompted the pursuit of more efficient alternatives. As a representative work non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) have been recognized for their rapid generation. However a major drawback of these models is their inferior performance compared to diffusion models. In this paper we aim to re-evaluate the full potential of NATs by revisiting the design of their training and inference strategies. Specifically we identify the complexities in properly configuring these strategies and indicate the possible sub-optimality in existing heuristic-driven designs. Recognizing this we propose to go beyond existing methods by directly solving the optimal strategies in an automatic framework. The resulting method named AutoNAT advances the performance boundaries of NATs notably and is able to perform comparably with the latest diffusion models with a significantly reduced inference cost. The effectiveness of AutoNAT is comprehensively validated on four benchmark datasets i.e. ImageNet-256 & 512 MS-COCO and CC3M. Code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ImprovedNAT.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ni_Revisiting_Non-Autoregressive_Transformers_for_Efficient_Image_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ANIM: Accurate Neural Implicit Model for Human Reconstruction from a single RGB-D Image,"Pesavento, Marco, Xu, Yuanlu, Sarafianos, Nikolaos, Maier, Robert, Wang, Ziyan, Yao, Chun-Han, Volino, Marco, Boyer, Edmond, Hilton, Adrian, Tung, Tony",Recent progress in human shape learning shows that neural implicit models are effective in generating 3D human surfaces from limited number of views and even from a single RGB image. However existing monocular approaches still struggle to recover fine geometric details such as face hands or cloth wrinkles. They are also easily prone to depth ambiguities that result in distorted geometries along the camera optical axis. In this paper we explore the benefits of incorporating depth observations in the reconstruction process by introducing ANIM a novel method that reconstructs arbitrary 3D human shapes from single-view RGB-D images with an unprecedented level of accuracy. Our model learns geometric details from both multi-resolution pixel-aligned and voxel-aligned features to leverage depth information and enable spatial relationships mitigating depth ambiguities. We further enhance the quality of the reconstructed shape by introducing a depth-supervision strategy which improves the accuracy of the signed distance field estimation of points that lie on the reconstructed surface. Experiments demonstrate that ANIM outperforms state-of-the-art works that use RGB surface normals point cloud or RGB-D data as input. In addition we introduce ANIM-Real a new multi-modal dataset comprising high-quality scans paired with consumer-grade RGB-D camera and our protocol to fine-tune ANIM enabling high-quality reconstruction from real-world human capture.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Pesavento_ANIM_Accurate_Neural_Implicit_Model_for_Human_Reconstruction_from_a_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Real-Time Simulated Avatar from Head-Mounted Sensors,"Luo, Zhengyi, Cao, Jinkun, Khirodkar, Rawal, Winkler, Alexander, Kitani, Kris, Xu, Weipeng",We present SimXR a method for controlling a simulated avatar from information (headset pose and cameras) obtained from AR / VR headsets. Due to the challenging viewpoint of head-mounted cameras the human body is often clipped out of view making traditional image-based egocentric pose estimation challenging. On the other hand headset poses provide valuable information about overall body motion but lack fine-grained details about the hands and feet. To synergize headset poses with cameras we control a humanoid to track headset movement while analyzing input images to decide body movement. When body parts are seen the movements of hands and feet will be guided by the images; when unseen the laws of physics guide the controller to generate plausible motion. We design an end-to-end method that does not rely on any intermediate representations and learns to directly map from images and headset poses to humanoid control signals. To train our method we also propose a large-scale synthetic dataset created using camera configurations compatible with a commercially available VR headset (Quest 2) and show promising results on real-world captures. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework we also test it on an AR headset with a forward-facing camera.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Luo_Real-Time_Simulated_Avatar_from_Head-Mounted_Sensors_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Seamless Human Motion Composition with Blended Positional Encodings,"Barquero, German, Escalera, Sergio, Palmero, Cristina",Conditional human motion generation is an important topic with many applications in virtual reality gaming and robotics. While prior works have focused on generating motion guided by text music or scenes these typically result in isolated motions confined to short durations. Instead we address the generation of long continuous sequences guided by a series of varying textual descriptions. In this context we introduce FlowMDM the first diffusion-based model that generates seamless Human Motion Compositions (HMC) without any postprocessing or redundant denoising steps. For this we introduce the Blended Positional Encodings a technique that leverages both absolute and relative positional encodings in the denoising chain. More specifically global motion coherence is recovered at the absolute stage whereas smooth and realistic transitions are built at the relative stage. As a result we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy realism and smoothness on the Babel and HumanML3D datasets. FlowMDM excels when trained with only a single description per motion sequence thanks to its Pose-Centric Cross-ATtention which makes it robust against varying text descriptions at inference time. Finally to address the limitations of existing HMC metrics we propose two new metrics: the Peak Jerk and the Area Under the Jerk to detect abrupt transitions.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Barquero_Seamless_Human_Motion_Composition_with_Blended_Positional_Encodings_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FedUV: Uniformity and Variance for Heterogeneous Federated Learning,"Son, Ha Min, Kim, Moon-Hyun, Chung, Tai-Myoung, Huang, Chao, Liu, Xin",Federated learning is a promising framework to train neural networks with widely distributed data. However performance degrades heavily with heterogeneously distributed data. Recent work has shown this is due to the final layer of the network being most prone to local bias some finding success freezing the final layer as an orthogonal classifier. We investigate the training dynamics of the classifier by applying SVD to the weights motivated by the observation that freezing weights results in constant singular values. We find that there are differences when training in IID and non-IID settings. Based on this finding we introduce two regularization terms for local training to continuously emulate IID settings: (1) variance in the dimension-wise probability distribution of the classifier and (2) hyperspherical uniformity of representations of the encoder. These regularizations promote local models to act as if it were in an IID setting regardless of the local data distribution thus offsetting proneness to bias while being flexible to the data. On extensive experiments in both label-shift and feature-shift settings we verify that our method achieves highest performance by a large margin especially in highly non-IID cases in addition to being scalable to larger models and datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Son_FedUV_Uniformity_and_Variance_for_Heterogeneous_Federated_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
GAvatar: Animatable 3D Gaussian Avatars with Implicit Mesh Learning,"Yuan, Ye, Li, Xueting, Huang, Yangyi, De Mello, Shalini, Nagano, Koki, Kautz, Jan, Iqbal, Umar",Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful 3D representation that harnesses the advantages of both explicit (mesh) and implicit (NeRF) 3D representations. In this paper we seek to leverage Gaussian splatting to generate realistic animatable avatars from textual descriptions addressing the limitations (e.g. efficiency and flexibility) imposed by mesh or NeRF-based representations. However a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To tackle these problems we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to facilitate animations. Second to stabilize and amortize the learning of millions of Gaussians we propose to use implicit neural fields to predict the Gaussian attributes (e.g. colors). Finally to capture fine avatar geometries and extract detailed meshes we propose a novel SDF-based implicit mesh learning approach for 3D Gaussians that regularizes the underlying geometries and extracts highly detailed textured meshes. Our proposed method GAvatar enables the large-scale generation of diverse animatable avatars using only text prompts. GAvatar significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of both appearance and geometry quality and achieves extremely fast rendering (100 fps) at 1K resolution.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yuan_GAvatar_Animatable_3D_Gaussian_Avatars_with_Implicit_Mesh_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Grounding Everything: Emerging Localization Properties in Vision-Language Transformers,"Bousselham, Walid, Petersen, Felix, Ferrari, Vittorio, Kuehne, Hilde",Vision-language foundation models have shown remarkable performance in various zero-shot settings such as image retrieval classification or captioning. But so far those models seem to fall behind when it comes to zero-shot localization of referential expressions and objects in images. As a result they need to be fine-tuned for this task. In this paper we show that pretrained vision-language (VL) models allow for zero-shot open-vocabulary object localization without any fine-tuning. To leverage those capabilities we propose a Grounding Everything Module (GEM) that generalizes the idea of value-value attention introduced by CLIPSurgery to a self-self attention path. We show that the concept of self-self attention corresponds to clustering thus enforcing groups of tokens arising from the same object to be similar while preserving the alignment with the language space. To further guide the group formation we propose a set of regularizations that allows the model to finally generalize across datasets and backbones. We evaluate the proposed GEM framework on various benchmark tasks and datasets for semantic segmentation. GEM not only outperforms other training-free open-vocabulary localization methods but also achieves state-of-the-art results on the recently proposed OpenImagesV7 large-scale segmentation benchmark. Code is available at https://github.com/WalBouss/GEM,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bousselham_Grounding_Everything_Emerging_Localization_Properties_in_Vision-Language_Transformers_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Mean-Shift Feature Transformer,"Kobayashi, Takumi",Transformer models developed in NLP make a great impact on computer vision fields producing promising performance on various tasks. While multi-head attention a characteristic mechanism of the transformer attracts keen research interest such as for reducing computation cost we analyze the transformer model from a viewpoint of feature transformation based on a distribution of input feature tokens. The analysis inspires us to derive a novel transformation method from mean-shift update which is an effective gradient ascent to seek a local mode of distinctive representation on the token distribution. We also present an efficient projection approach to reduce parameter size of linear projections constituting the proposed multi-head feature transformation. In the experiments on ImageNet-1K dataset the proposed methods embedded into various network models exhibit favorable performance improvement in place of the transformer module.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kobayashi_Mean-Shift_Feature_Transformer_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Domain Separation Graph Neural Networks for Saliency Object Ranking,"Wu, Zijian, Lu, Jun, Han, Jing, Bai, Lianfa, Zhang, Yi, Zhao, Zhuang, Song, Siyang",Saliency object ranking (SOR) has attracted significant attention recently. Previous methods usually failed to explicitly explore the saliency degree-related relationships between objects. In this paper we propose a novel Domain Separation Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) which starts with separately extracting the shape and texture cues from each object and builds an shape graph as well as a texture graph for all objects in the given image. Then we propose a Shape-Texture Graph Domain Separation (STGDS) module to separate the task-relevant and irrelevant information of target objects by explicitly modelling the relationship between each pair of objects in terms of their shapes and textures respectively. Furthermore a Cross Image Graph Domain Separation (CIGDS) module is introduced to explore the saliency degree subspace that is robust to different scenes aiming to create a unified representation for targets with the same saliency levels in different images. Importantly our DSGNN automatically learns a multi-dimensional feature to represent each graph edge allowing complex diverse and ranking-related relationships to be modelled. Experimental results show that our DSGNN achieved the new state-of-the-art performance on both ASSR and IRSR datasets with large improvements of 5.2% and 4.1% SA-SOR respectively. Our code is provided in https://github.com/Wu-ZJ/DSGNN.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wu_Domain_Separation_Graph_Neural_Networks_for_Saliency_Object_Ranking_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
RAM-Avatar: Real-time Photo-Realistic Avatar from Monocular Videos with Full-body Control,"Deng, Xiang, Zheng, Zerong, Zhang, Yuxiang, Sun, Jingxiang, Xu, Chao, Yang, Xiaodong, Wang, Lizhen, Liu, Yebin",This paper focuses on advancing the applicability of human avatar learning methods by proposing RAM-Avatar which learns a Real-time photo-realistic Avatar that supports full-body control from Monocular videos. To achieve this goal RAM-Avatar leverages two statistical templates responsible for modeling the facial expression and hand gesture variations while a sparsely computed dual attention module is introduced upon another body template to facilitate high-fidelity texture rendering for the torsos and limbs. Building on this foundation we deploy a lightweight yet powerful StyleUnet along with a temporal-aware discriminator to achieve real-time realistic rendering. To enable robust animation for out-of-distribution poses we propose a Motion Distribution Align module to compensate for the discrepancies between the training and testing motion distribution. Results and extensive experiments conducted in various experimental settings demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method and a real-time live system is proposed to further push research into applications. The training and testing code will be released for research purposes.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Deng_RAM-Avatar_Real-time_Photo-Realistic_Avatar_from_Monocular_Videos_with_Full-body_Control_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Video Prediction by Modeling Videos as Continuous Multi-Dimensional Processes,"Shrivastava, Gaurav, Shrivastava, Abhinav",Diffusion models have made significant strides in image generation mastering tasks such as unconditional image synthesis text-image translation and image-to-image conversions. However their capability falls short in the realm of video prediction mainly because they treat videos as a collection of independent images relying on external constraints such as temporal attention mechanisms to enforce temporal coherence. In our paper we introduce a novel model class that treats video as a continuous multi-dimensional process rather than a series of discrete frames. Through extensive experimentation we establish state-of-the-art performance in video prediction validated on benchmark datasets including KTH BAIR Human3.6M and UCF101.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shrivastava_Video_Prediction_by_Modeling_Videos_as_Continuous_Multi-Dimensional_Processes_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PICTURE: PhotorealistIC virtual Try-on from UnconstRained dEsigns,"Ning, Shuliang, Wang, Duomin, Qin, Yipeng, Jin, Zirong, Wang, Baoyuan, Han, Xiaoguang",In this paper we propose a novel virtual try-on from unconstrained designs (ucVTON) task to enable photorealistic synthesis of personalized composite clothing on input human images. Unlike prior arts constrained by specific input types our method allows flexible specification of style (text or image) and texture (full garment cropped sections or texture patches) conditions. To address the entanglement challenge when using full garment images as conditions we develop a two-stage pipeline with explicit disentanglement of style and texture. In the first stage we generate a human parsing map reflecting the desired style conditioned on the input. In the second stage we composite textures onto the parsing map areas based on the texture input. To represent complex and non-stationary textures that have never been achieved in previous fashion editing works we first propose extracting hierarchical and balanced CLIP features and applying position encoding in VTON. Experiments demonstrate superior synthesis quality and personalization enabled by our method. The flexible control over style and texture mixing brings virtual try-on to a new level of user experience for online shopping and fashion design.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ning_PICTURE_PhotorealistIC_virtual_Try-on_from_UnconstRained_dEsigns_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Towards Robust 3D Pose Transfer with Adversarial Learning,"Chen, Haoyu, Tang, Hao, Adeli, Ehsan, Zhao, Guoying",3D pose transfer that aims to transfer the desired pose to a target mesh is one of the most challenging 3D generation tasks. Previous attempts rely on well-defined parametric human models or skeletal joints as driving pose sources. However to obtain those clean pose sources cumbersome but necessary pre-processing pipelines are inevitable hindering implementations of the real-time applications. This work is driven by the intuition that the robustness of the model can be enhanced by introducing adversarial samples into the training leading to a more invulnerable model to the noisy inputs which even can be further extended to directly handling the real-world data like raw point clouds/scans without intermediate processing. Furthermore we propose a novel 3D pose Masked Autoencoder (3D-PoseMAE) a customized MAE that effectively learns 3D extrinsic presentations (i.e. pose). 3D-PoseMAE facilitates learning from the aspect of extrinsic attributes by simultaneously generating adversarial samples that perturb the model and learning the arbitrary raw noisy poses via a multi-scale masking strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative studies show that the transferred meshes given by our network result in much better quality. Besides we demonstrate the strong generalizability of our method on various poses different domains and even raw scans. Experimental results also show meaningful insights that the intermediate adversarial samples generated in the training can successfully attack the existing pose transfer models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Towards_Robust_3D_Pose_Transfer_with_Adversarial_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
EAGLE: Eigen Aggregation Learning for Object-Centric Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation,"Kim, Chanyoung, Han, Woojung, Ju, Dayun, Hwang, Seong Jae",Semantic segmentation has innately relied on extensive pixel-level annotated data leading to the emergence of unsupervised methodologies. Among them leveraging self-supervised Vision Transformers for unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) has been making steady progress with expressive deep features. Yet for semantically segmenting images with complex objects a predominant challenge remains: the lack of explicit object-level semantic encoding in patch-level features. This technical limitation often leads to inadequate segmentation of complex objects with diverse structures. To address this gap we present a novel approach EAGLE which emphasizes object-centric representation learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation. Specifically we introduce EiCue a spectral technique providing semantic and structural cues through an eigenbasis derived from the semantic similarity matrix of deep image features and color affinity from an image. Further by incorporating our object-centric contrastive loss with EiCue we guide our model to learn object-level representations with intra- and inter-image object-feature consistency thereby enhancing semantic accuracy. Extensive experiments on COCO-Stuff Cityscapes and Potsdam-3 datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art USS results of EAGLE with accurate and consistent semantic segmentation across complex scenes.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kim_EAGLE_Eigen_Aggregation_Learning_for_Object-Centric_Unsupervised_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AVID: Any-Length Video Inpainting with Diffusion Model,"Zhang, Zhixing, Wu, Bichen, Wang, Xiaoyan, Luo, Yaqiao, Zhang, Luxin, Zhao, Yinan, Vajda, Peter, Metaxas, Dimitris, Yu, Licheng",Recent advances in diffusion models have successfully enabled text-guided image inpainting. While it seems straightforward to extend such editing capability into the video domain there have been fewer works regarding text-guided video inpainting. Given a video a masked region at its initial frame and an editing prompt it requires a model to do infilling at each frame following the editing guidance while keeping the out-of-mask region intact. There are three main challenges in text-guided video inpainting: (i) temporal consistency of the edited video (ii) supporting different inpainting types at different structural fidelity levels and (iii) dealing with variable video length. To address these challenges we introduce Any-Length Video Inpainting with Diffusion Model dubbed as AVID. At its core our model is equipped with effective motion modules and adjustable structure guidance for fixed-length video inpainting. Building on top of that we propose a novel Temporal MultiDiffusion sampling pipeline with a middle-frame attention guidance mechanism facilitating the generation of videos with any desired duration. Our comprehensive experiments show our model can robustly deal with various inpainting types at different video duration ranges with high quality.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_AVID_Any-Length_Video_Inpainting_with_Diffusion_Model_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
NoiseCollage: A Layout-Aware Text-to-Image Diffusion Model Based on Noise Cropping and Merging,"Shirakawa, Takahiro, Uchida, Seiichi",Layout-aware text-to-image generation is a task to generate multi-object images that reflect layout conditions in addition to text conditions. The current layout-aware text-to-image diffusion models still have several issues including mismatches between the text and layout conditions and quality degradation of generated images. This paper proposes a novel layout-aware text-to-image diffusion model called NoiseCollage to tackle these issues. During the denoising process NoiseCollage independently estimates noises for individual objects and then crops and merges them into a single noise. This operation helps avoid condition mismatches; in other words it can put the right objects in the right places. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that NoiseCollage outperforms several state-of-the-art models. These successful results indicate that the crop-and-merge operation of noises is a reasonable strategy to control image generation. We also show that NoiseCollage can be integrated with ControlNet to use edges sketches and pose skeletons as additional conditions. Experimental results show that this integration boosts the layout accuracy of ControlNet. The code is available at https://github.com/univ-esuty/noisecollage.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shirakawa_NoiseCollage_A_Layout-Aware_Text-to-Image_Diffusion_Model_Based_on_Noise_Cropping_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Arbitrary Motion Style Transfer with Multi-condition Motion Latent Diffusion Model,"Song, Wenfeng, Jin, Xingliang, Li, Shuai, Chen, Chenglizhao, Hao, Aimin, Hou, Xia, Li, Ning, Qin, Hong",Computer animation's quest to bridge content and style has historically been a challenging venture with previous efforts often leaning toward one at the expense of the other. This paper tackles the inherent challenge of content-style duality ensuring a harmonious fusion where the core narrative of the content is both preserved and elevated through stylistic enhancements. We propose a novel Multi-condition Motion Latent Diffusion Model (MCM-LDM) for Arbitrary Motion Style Transfer (AMST). Our MCM-LDM significantly emphasizes preserving trajectories recognizing their fundamental role in defining the essence and fluidity of motion content. Our MCM-LDM's cornerstone lies in its ability first to disentangle and then intricately weave together motion's tripartite components: motion trajectory motion content and motion style. The critical insight of MCM-LDM is to embed multiple conditions with distinct priorities. The content channel serves as the primary flow guiding the overall structure and movement while the trajectory and style channels act as auxiliary components and synchronize with the primary one dynamically. This mechanism ensures that multi-conditions can seamlessly integrate into the main flow enhancing the overall animation without overshadowing the core content. Empirical evaluations underscore the model's proficiency in achieving fluid and authentic motion style transfers setting a new benchmark in the realm of computer animation. The source code and model are available at https://github.com/XingliangJin/MCM-LDM.git.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Song_Arbitrary_Motion_Style_Transfer_with_Multi-condition_Motion_Latent_Diffusion_Model_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ViT-CoMer: Vision Transformer with Convolutional Multi-scale Feature Interaction for Dense Predictions,"Xia, Chunlong, Wang, Xinliang, Lv, Feng, Hao, Xin, Shi, Yifeng",Although Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved significant success in computer vision it does not perform well in dense prediction tasks due to the lack of inner-patch information interaction and the limited diversity of feature scale. Most existing studies are devoted to designing vision-specific transformers to solve the above problems which introduce additional pre-training costs. Therefore we present a plain pre-training-free and feature-enhanced ViT backbone with Convolutional Multi-scale feature interaction named ViT-CoMer which facilitates bidirectional interaction between CNN and transformer. Compared to the state-of-the-art ViT-CoMer has the following advantages: (1) We inject spatial pyramid multi-receptive field convolutional features into the ViT architecture which effectively alleviates the problems of limited local information interaction and single-feature representation in ViT. (2) We propose a simple and efficient CNN-Transformer bidirectional fusion interaction module that performs multi-scale fusion across hierarchical features which is beneficial for handling dense prediction tasks. (3) We evaluate the performance of ViT-CoMer across various dense prediction tasks different frameworks and multiple advanced pre-training. Notably our ViT-CoMer-L achieves 64.3% AP on COCO val2017 without extra training data and 62.1% mIoU on ADE20K val both of which are comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We hope ViT-CoMer can serve as a new backbone for dense prediction tasks to facilitate future research. The code will be released at https://github.com/Traffic-X/ViT-CoMer.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xia_ViT-CoMer_Vision_Transformer_with_Convolutional_Multi-scale_Feature_Interaction_for_Dense_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PromptCoT: Align Prompt Distribution via Adapted Chain-of-Thought,"Yao, Junyi, Liu, Yijiang, Dong, Zhen, Guo, Mingfei, Hu, Helan, Keutzer, Kurt, Du, Li, Zhou, Daquan, Zhang, Shanghang","Diffusion-based generative models have exhibited remarkable capability in the production of high-fidelity visual content such as images and videos. However their performance is significantly contingent upon the quality of textual inputs commonly referred to as ""prompts"". The process of traditional prompt engineering while effective necessitates empirical expertise and poses challenges for inexperienced users. In this paper we introduce PromptCoT an innovative enhancer that autonomously refines prompts for users. PromptCoT is designed based on the observation that prompts which resemble the textual information of high-quality images in the training set often lead to superior generation performance. Therefore we fine-tune the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLM) using a curated text dataset that solely comprises descriptions of high-quality visual content. By doing so the LLM can capture the distribution of high-quality training texts enabling it to generate aligned continuations and revisions to boost the original texts. Nonetheless one drawback of pre-trained LLMs is their tendency to generate extraneous or irrelevant information. We employ the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism to improve the alignment between the original text prompts and their refined versions. CoT can extract and amalgamate crucial information from the aligned continuation and revision enabling reasonable inferences based on the contextual cues to produce a more comprehensive and nuanced final output. Considering computational efficiency instead of allocating a dedicated LLM for prompt enhancement to each individual model or dataset we integrate adapters that facilitate dataset-specific adaptation leveraging a shared pre-trained LLM as the foundation for this process. With independent fine-tuning of these adapters we can adapt PromptCoT to new datasets while minimally increasing training costs and memory usage. We evaluate the effectiveness of PromptCoT by assessing its performance on widely-used latent diffusion models for image and video generation. The results demonstrate significant improvements in key performance metrics.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yao_PromptCoT_Align_Prompt_Distribution_via_Adapted_Chain-of-Thought_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Anomaly Score: Evaluating Generative Models and Individual Generated Images based on Complexity and Vulnerability,"Hwang, Jaehui, Lee, Junghyuk, Lee, Jong-Seok",With the advancement of generative models the assessment of generated images becomes increasingly more important. Previous methods measure distances between features of reference and generated images from trained vision models. In this paper we conduct an extensive investigation into the relationship between the representation space and input space around generated images. We first propose two measures related to the presence of unnatural elements within images: complexity which indicates how non-linear the representation space is and vulnerability which is related to how easily the extracted feature changes by adversarial input changes. Based on these we introduce a new metric to evaluating image-generative models called anomaly score (AS). Moreover we propose AS-i (anomaly score for individual images) that can effectively evaluate generated images individually. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hwang_Anomaly_Score_Evaluating_Generative_Models_and_Individual_Generated_Images_based_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
GeneAvatar: Generic Expression-Aware Volumetric Head Avatar Editing from a Single Image,"Bao, Chong, Zhang, Yinda, Li, Yuan, Zhang, Xiyu, Yang, Bangbang, Bao, Hujun, Pollefeys, Marc, Zhang, Guofeng, Cui, Zhaopeng",Recently we have witnessed the explosive growth of various volumetric representations in modeling animatable head avatars. However due to the diversity of frameworks there is no practical method to support high-level applications like 3D head avatar editing across different representations. In this paper we propose a generic avatar editing approach that can be universally applied to various 3DMM driving volumetric head avatars. To achieve this goal we design a novel expression-aware modification generative model which enables lift 2D editing from a single image to a consistent 3D modification field. To ensure the effectiveness of the generative modification process we develop several techniques including an expression-dependent modification distillation scheme to draw knowledge from the large-scale head avatar model and 2D facial texture editing tools implicit latent space guidance to enhance model convergence and a segmentation-based loss reweight strategy for fine-grained texture inversion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers high-quality and consistent results across multiple expression and viewpoints.

Learn to Rectify the Bias of CLIP for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation,"Wang, Jingyun, Kang, Guoliang","Recent works utilize CLIP to perform the challenging unsupervised semantic segmentation task where only images without annotations are available. However we observe that when adopting CLIP to such a pixel-level understanding task unexpected bias occurs. Previous works don't explicitly model such bias which largely constrains the segmentation performance. In this paper we propose to explicitly model and rectify the bias existing in CLIP to facilitate the unsupervised semantic segmentation. Specifically we design a learnable ""Reference"" prompt to encode class-preference bias and project the positional embedding of vision transformer to represent space-preference bias. Via a simple element-wise subtraction we rectify the logits of CLIP classifier. Based on the rectified logits we generate a segmentation mask via a Gumbel-Softmax operation. Then a contrastive loss between masked visual feature and the text features of different classes is imposed to facilitate the effective bias modeling. To further improve the segmentation we distill the knowledge from the rectified CLIP to the advanced segmentation architecture via minimizing our designed mask-guided feature-guided and text-guided loss terms. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts. The implementation is available at https://github.com/dogehhh/ReCLIP.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Learn_to_Rectify_the_Bias_of_CLIP_for_Unsupervised_Semantic_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Unlocking Pre-trained Image Backbones for Semantic Image Synthesis,"Ifriqi, Tariq Berrada, Verbeek, Jakob, Couprie, Camille, Alahari, Karteek",Semantic image synthesis i.e. generating images from user-provided semantic label maps is an important conditional image generation task as it allows to control both the content as well as the spatial layout of generated images. Although diffusion models have pushed the state of the art in generative image modeling the iterative nature of their inference process makes them computationally demanding. Other approaches such as GANs are more efficient as they only need a single feed-forward pass for generation but the image quality tends to suffer when modeling large and diverse datasets. In this work we propose a new class of GAN discriminators for semantic image synthesis that generates highly realistic images by exploiting feature backbones pre-trained for tasks such as image classification. We also introduce a new generator architecture with better context modeling and using cross-attention to inject noise into latent variables leading to more diverse generated images. Our model which we dub DP-SIMS achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality and consistency with the input label maps on ADE-20K COCO-Stuff and Cityscapes surpassing recent diffusion models while requiring two orders of magnitude less compute for inference.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ifriqi_Unlocking_Pre-trained_Image_Backbones_for_Semantic_Image_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
TexTile: A Differentiable Metric for Texture Tileability,"Rodriguez-Pardo, Carlos, Casas, Dan, Garces, Elena, Lopez-Moreno, Jorge",We introduce TexTile a novel differentiable metric to quantify the degree upon which a texture image can be concatenated with itself without introducing repeating artifacts (i.e. the tileability). Existing methods for tileable texture synthesis focus on general texture quality but lack explicit analysis of the intrinsic repeatability properties of a texture. In contrast our TexTile metric effectively evaluates the tileable properties of a texture opening the door to more informed synthesis and analysis of tileable textures. Under the hood TexTile is formulated as a binary classifier carefully built from a large dataset of textures of different styles semantics regularities and human annotations.Key to our method is a set of architectural modifications to baseline pre-train image classifiers to overcome their shortcomings at measuring tileability along with a custom data augmentation and training regime aimed at increasing robustness and accuracy. We demonstrate that TexTile can be plugged into different state-of-the-art texture synthesis methods including diffusion-based strategies and generate tileable textures while keeping or even improving the overall texture quality. Furthermore we show that TexTile can objectively evaluate any tileable texture synthesis method whereas the current mix of existing metrics produces uncorrelated scores which heavily hinders progress in the field.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Rodriguez-Pardo_TexTile_A_Differentiable_Metric_for_Texture_Tileability_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Improving Image Restoration through Removing Degradations in Textual Representations,"Lin, Jingbo, Zhang, Zhilu, Wei, Yuxiang, Ren, Dongwei, Jiang, Dongsheng, Tian, Qi, Zuo, Wangmeng",In this paper we introduce a new perspective for improving image restoration by removing degradation in the textual representations of a given degraded image. Intuitively restoration is much easier on text modality than image one. For example it can be easily conducted by removing degradation-related words while keeping the content-aware words. Hence we combine the advantages of images in detail description and ones of text in degradation removal to perform restoration. To address the cross-modal assistance we propose to map the degraded images into textual representations for removing the degradations and then convert the restored textual representations into a guidance image for assisting image restoration. In particular We ingeniously embed an image-to-text mapper and text restoration module into CLIP-equipped text-to-image models to generate the guidance. Then we adopt a simple coarse-to-fine approach to dynamically inject multi-scale information from guidance to image restoration networks. Extensive experiments are conducted on various image restoration tasks including deblurring dehazing deraining and denoising and all-in-one image restoration. The results showcase that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ones across all these tasks.

ZONE: Zero-Shot Instruction-Guided Local Editing,"Li, Shanglin, Zeng, Bohan, Feng, Yutang, Gao, Sicheng, Liu, Xiuhui, Liu, Jiaming, Li, Lin, Tang, Xu, Hu, Yao, Liu, Jianzhuang, Zhang, Baochang","Recent advances in vision-language models like Stable Diffusion have shown remarkable power in creative image synthesis and editing.However most existing text-to-image editing methods encounter two obstacles: First the text prompt needs to be carefully crafted to achieve good results which is not intuitive or user-friendly. Second they are insensitive to local edits and can irreversibly affect non-edited regions leaving obvious editing traces. To tackle these problems we propose a Zero-shot instructiON-guided local image Editing approach termed ZONE. We first convert the editing intent from the user-provided instruction (e.g. ""make his tie blue"") into specific image editing regions through InstructPix2Pix. We then propose a Region-IoU scheme for precise image layer extraction from an off-the-shelf segment model. We further develop an edge smoother based on FFT for seamless blending between the layer and the image.Our method allows for arbitrary manipulation of a specific region with a single instruction while preserving the rest. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ZONE achieves remarkable local editing results and user-friendliness outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

U-VAP: User-specified Visual Appearance Personalization via Decoupled Self Augmentation,"Wu, You, Liu, Kean, Mi, Xiaoyue, Tang, Fan, Cao, Juan, Li, Jintao",Concept personalization methods enable large text-to-image models to learn specific subjects (e.g. objects/poses/3D models) and synthesize renditions in new contexts. Given that the image references are highly biased towards visual attributes state-of-the-art personalization models tend to overfit the whole subject and cannot disentangle visual characteristics in pixel space. In this study we proposed a more challenging setting namely fine-grained visual appearance personalization. Different from existing methods we allow users to provide a sentence describing the desired attributes. A novel decoupled self-augmentation strategy is proposed to generate target-related and non-target samples to learn user-specified visual attributes.These augmented data allow for refining the model's understanding of the target attribute while mitigating the impact of unrelated attributes. At the inference stage adjustments are conducted on semantic space through the learned target and non-target embeddings to further enhance the disentanglement of target attributes. Extensive experiments on various kinds of visual attributes with SOTA personalization methods shows the ability of the proposed method to mimic target visual appearance in novel contexts thus improving the controllability and flexibility of personalization.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wu_U-VAP_User-specified_Visual_Appearance_Personalization_via_Decoupled_Self_Augmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HHMR: Holistic Hand Mesh Recovery by Enhancing the Multimodal Controllability of Graph Diffusion Models,"Li, Mengcheng, Zhang, Hongwen, Zhang, Yuxiang, Shao, Ruizhi, Yu, Tao, Liu, Yebin",Recent years have witnessed a trend of the deep integration of the generation and reconstruction paradigms. In this paper we extend the ability of controllable generative models for a more comprehensive hand mesh recovery task: direct hand mesh generation inpainting reconstruction and fitting in a single framework which we name as Holistic Hand Mesh Recovery (HHMR). Our key observation is that different kinds of hand mesh recovery tasks can be achieved by a single generative model with strong multimodal controllability and in such a framework realizing different tasks only requires giving different signals as conditions. To achieve this goal we propose an all-in-one diffusion framework based on graph convolution and attention mechanisms for holistic hand mesh recovery. In order to achieve strong control generation capability while ensuring the decoupling of multimodal control signals we map different modalities to a share feature space and apply cross-scale random masking in both modality and feature levels. In this way the correlation between different modalities can be fully exploited during the learning of hand priors. Furthermore we propose Condition-aligned Gradient Guidance to enhance the alignment of the generated model with the control signals which significantly improves the accuracy of the hand mesh reconstruction and fitting. Experiments show that our novel framework can realize multiple hand mesh recovery tasks simultaneously and outperform the existing methods in different tasks which provides more possibilities for subsequent downstream applications including gesture recognition pose generation mesh editing and so on.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_HHMR_Holistic_Hand_Mesh_Recovery_by_Enhancing_the_Multimodal_Controllability_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Robust Self-calibration of Focal Lengths from the Fundamental Matrix,"Kocur, Viktor, Kyselica, Daniel, Kukelova, Zuzana",The problem of self-calibration of two cameras from a given fundamental matrix is one of the basic problems in geometric computer vision. Under the assumption of known principal points and square pixels the Bougnoux formula offers a means to compute the two unknown focal lengths. However in many practical situations the formula yields inaccurate results due to commonly occurring singularities. Moreover the estimates are sensitive to noise in the computed fundamental matrix and to the assumed positions of the principal points. In this paper we therefore propose an efficient and robust iterative method to estimate the focal lengths along with the principal points of the cameras given a fundamental matrix and priors for the estimated camera intrinsics. In addition we study a computationally efficient check of models generated within RANSAC that improves the accuracy of the estimated models while reducing the total computational time. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show that our iterative method brings significant improvements in terms of the accuracy of the estimated focal lengths over the Bougnoux formula and other state-of-the-art methods even when relying on inaccurate priors. The code for the methods and experiments is available at https://github.com/kocurvik/robust_self_calibration,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kocur_Robust_Self-calibration_of_Focal_Lengths_from_the_Fundamental_Matrix_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PartDistill: 3D Shape Part Segmentation by Vision-Language Model Distillation,"Umam, Ardian, Yang, Cheng-Kun, Chen, Min-Hung, Chuang, Jen-Hui, Lin, Yen-Yu",This paper proposes a cross-modal distillation framework PartDistill which transfers 2D knowledge from vision-language models (VLMs) to facilitate 3D shape part segmentation. PartDistill addresses three major challenges in this task: the lack of 3D segmentation in invisible or undetected regions in the 2D projections inconsistent 2D predictions by VLMs and the lack of knowledge accumulation across different 3D shapes. PartDistill consists of a teacher network that uses a VLM to make 2D predictions and a student network that learns from the 2D predictions while extracting geometrical features from multiple 3D shapes to carry out 3D part segmentation. A bi-directional distillation including forward and backward distillations is carried out within the framework where the former forward distills the 2D predictions to the student network and the latter improves the quality of the 2D predictions which subsequently enhances the final 3D segmentation. Moreover PartDistill can exploit generative models that facilitate effortless 3D shape creation for generating knowledge sources to be distilled. Through extensive experiments PartDistill boosts the existing methods with substantial margins on widely used ShapeNetPart and PartNetE datasets by more than 15% and 12% higher mIoU scores respectively.

DragDiffusion: Harnessing Diffusion Models for Interactive Point-based Image Editing,"Shi, Yujun, Xue, Chuhui, Liew, Jun Hao, Pan, Jiachun, Yan, Hanshu, Zhang, Wenqing, Tan, Vincent Y. F., Bai, Song",Accurate and controllable image editing is a challenging task that has attracted significant attention recently. Notably DragGAN developed by Pan et al. (2023) is an interactive point-based image editing framework that achieves impressive editing results with pixel-level precision. However due to its reliance on generative adversarial networks (GANs) its generality is limited by the capacity of pretrained GAN models. In this work we extend this editing framework to diffusion models and propose a novel approach DragDiffusion. By harnessing large-scale pretrained diffusion models we greatly enhance the applicability of interactive point-based editing on both real and diffusion-generated images. Unlike other diffusion-based editing methods that provide guidance on diffusion latents of multiple time steps our approach achieves efficient yet accurate spatial control by optimizing the latent of only one time step. This novel design is motivated by our observations that UNet features at a specific time step provides sufficient semantic and geometric information to support the drag-based editing. Moreover we introduce two additional techniques namely identity-preserving fine-tuning and reference-latent-control to further preserve the identity of the original image. Lastly we present a challenging benchmark dataset called DragBench---the first benchmark to evaluate the performance of interactive point-based image editing methods. Experiments across a wide range of challenging cases (e.g. images with multiple objects diverse object categories various styles etc.) demonstrate the versatility and generality of DragDiffusion.

Addressing Background Context Bias in Few-Shot Segmentation through Iterative Modulation,"Zhu, Lanyun, Chen, Tianrun, Yin, Jianxiong, See, Simon, Liu, Jun",Existing few-shot segmentation methods usually extract foreground prototypes from support images to guide query image segmentation. However different background contexts of support and query images can cause their foreground features to be misaligned. This phenomenon known as background context bias can hinder the effectiveness of support prototypes in guiding query image segmentation. In this work we propose a novel framework with an iterative structure to address this problem. In each iteration of the framework we first generate a query prediction based on a support foreground feature. Next we extract background context from the query image to modulate the support foreground feature thus eliminating the foreground feature misalignment caused by the different backgrounds. After that we design a confidence-biased attention to eliminate noise and cleanse information. By integrating these components through an iterative structure we create a novel network that can leverage the synergies between different modules to improve their performance in a mutually reinforcing manner. Through these carefully designed components and structures our network can effectively eliminate background context bias in few-shot segmentation thus achieving outstanding performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the PASCAL-5^ i  and COCO-20^ i  datasets and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_Addressing_Background_Context_Bias_in_Few-Shot_Segmentation_through_Iterative_Modulation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
TiNO-Edit: Timestep and Noise Optimization for Robust Diffusion-Based Image Editing,"Chen, Sherry X, Vaxman, Yaron, Ben Baruch, Elad, Asulin, David, Moreshet, Aviad, Lien, Kuo-Chin, Sra, Misha, Sen, Pradeep",Despite many attempts to leverage pre-trained text-to-image models (T2I) like Stable Diffusion (SD) for controllable image editing producing good predictable results remains a challenge. Previous approaches have focused on either fine-tuning pre-trained T2I models on specific datasets to generate certain kinds of images (e.g. with a specific object or person) or on optimizing the weights text prompts and/or learning features for each input image in an attempt to coax the image generator to produce the desired result. However these approaches all have shortcomings and fail to produce good results in a predictable and controllable manner. To address this problem we present TiNO-Edit an SD-based method that focuses on optimizing the noise patterns and diffusion timesteps during editing something previously unexplored in the literature. With this simple change we are able to generate results that both better align with the original images and reflect the desired result. Furthermore we propose a set of new loss functions that operate in the latent domain of SD greatly speeding up the optimization when compared to prior losses which operate in the pixel domain. Our method can be easily applied to variations of SD including Textual Inversion and DreamBooth that encode new concepts and incorporate them into the edited results. We present a host of image-editing capabilities enabled by our approach.

AdaShift: Learning Discriminative Self-Gated Neural Feature Activation With an Adaptive Shift Factor,"Cai, Sudong",Nonlinearities are decisive in neural representation learning. Traditional Activation (Act) functions impose fixed inductive biases on neural networks with oriented biological intuitions. Recent methods leverage self-gated curves to compensate for the rigid traditional Act paradigms in fitting flexibility. However substantial improvements are still impeded by the norm-induced mismatched feature re-calibrations (see Section 1) i.e. the actual importance of a feature can be inconsistent with its explicit intensity such that violates the basic intention of a direct self-gated feature re-weighting. To address this problem we propose to learn discriminative neural feature Act with a novel prototype namely AdaShift which enhances typical self-gated Act by incorporating an adaptive shift factor into the re-weighting function of Act. AdaShift casts dynamic translations on the inputs of a re-weighting function by exploiting comprehensive feature-filter context cues of different ranges in a simple yet effective manner. We obtain the new intuitions of AdaShift by rethinking the feature-filter relationships from a common Softmax-based classification and by generalizing the new observations to a common learning layer that encodes features with updatable filters. Our practical AdaShifts built upon the new Act prototype demonstrate significant improvements to the popular/SOTA Act functions on different vision benchmarks. By simply replacing ReLU with AdaShifts ResNets can match advanced Transformer counterparts (e.g. ResNet-50 vs. Swin-T) with lower cost and fewer parameters.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cai_AdaShift_Learning_Discriminative_Self-Gated_Neural_Feature_Activation_With_an_Adaptive_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SCEdit: Efficient and Controllable Image Diffusion Generation via Skip Connection Editing,"Jiang, Zeyinzi, Mao, Chaojie, Pan, Yulin, Han, Zhen, Zhang, Jingfeng",Image diffusion models have been utilized in various tasks such as text-to-image generation and controllable image synthesis. Recent research has introduced tuning methods that make subtle adjustments to the original models yielding promising results in specific adaptations of foundational generative diffusion models. Rather than modifying the main backbone of the diffusion model we delve into the role of skip connection in U-Net and reveal that hierarchical features aggregating long-distance information across encoder and decoder make a significant impact on the content and quality of image generation. Based on the observation we propose an efficient generative tuning framework dubbed SCEdit which integrates and edits Skip Connection using a lightweight tuning module named SC-Tuner. Furthermore the proposed framework allows for straightforward extension to controllable image synthesis by injecting different conditions with Controllable SC-Tuner simplifying and unifying the network design for multi-condition inputs. Our SCEdit substantially reduces training parameters memory usage and computational expense due to its lightweight tuners with backward propagation only passing to the decoder blocks. Extensive experiments conducted on text-to-image generation and controllable image synthesis tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of efficiency and performance.

BA-SAM: Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask for Segment Anything Model,"Song, Yiran, Zhou, Qianyu, Li, Xiangtai, Fan, Deng-Ping, Lu, Xuequan, Ma, Lizhuang",In this paper we address the challenge of image resolution variation for the Segment Anything Model (SAM). SAM known for its zero-shot generalizability exhibits a performance degradation when faced with datasets with varying image sizes. Previous approaches tend to resize the image to a fixed size or adopt structure modifications hindering the preservation of SAM's rich prior knowledge. Besides such task-specific tuning necessitates a complete retraining of the model which is cost-expensive and unacceptable for deployment in the downstream tasks. In this paper we reformulate this challenge as a length extrapolation problem where token sequence length varies while maintaining a consistent patch size for images with different sizes. To this end we propose a Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask (BA-SAM) to enhance SAM's adaptability to varying image resolutions while eliminating the need for structure modifications. Firstly we introduce a new scaling factor to ensure consistent magnitude in the attention layer's dot product values when the token sequence length changes. Secondly we present a bias-mode attention mask that allows each token to prioritize neighboring information mitigating the impact of untrained distant information. Our BA-SAM demonstrates efficacy in two scenarios: zero-shot and fine-tuning. Extensive evaluation of diverse datasets including DIS5K DUTS ISIC COD10K and COCO reveals its ability to significantly mitigate performance degradation in the zero-shot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning. Furthermore we propose a generalized model and benchmark showcasing BA-SAM's generalizability across all four datasets simultaneously.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Song_BA-SAM_Scalable_Bias-Mode_Attention_Mask_for_Segment_Anything_Model_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Deciphering 'What' and 'Where' Visual Pathways from Spectral Clustering of Layer-Distributed Neural Representations,"Zhang, Xiao, Yunis, David, Maire, Michael",We present an approach for analyzing grouping information contained within a neural network's activations permitting extraction of spatial layout and semantic segmentation from the behavior of large pre-trained vision models. Unlike prior work our method conducts a wholistic analysis of a network's activation state leveraging features from all layers and obviating the need to guess which part of the model contains relevant information. Motivated by classic spectral clustering we formulate this analysis in terms of an optimization objective involving a set of affinity matrices each formed by comparing features within a different layer. Solving this optimization problem using gradient descent allows our technique to scale from single images to dataset-level analysis including in the latter both intra- and inter-image relationships. Analyzing a pre-trained generative transformer provides insight into the computational strategy learned by such models. Equating affinity with key-query similarity across attention layers yields eigenvectors encoding scene spatial layout whereas defining affinity by value vector similarity yields eigenvectors encoding object identity. This result suggests that key and query vectors coordinate attentional information flow according to spatial proximity (a `where' pathway) while value vectors refine a semantic category representation (a `what' pathway).,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Deciphering_What_and_Where_Visual_Pathways_from_Spectral_Clustering_of_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Real-Time Exposure Correction via Collaborative Transformations and Adaptive Sampling,"Li, Ziwen, Zhang, Feng, Cao, Meng, Zhang, Jinpu, Shao, Yuanjie, Wang, Yuehuan, Sang, Nong",Most of the previous exposure correction methods learn dense pixel-wise transformations to achieve promising results but consume huge computational resources. Recently Learnable 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) have demonstrated impressive performance and efficiency for image enhancement. However these methods can only perform global transformations and fail to finely manipulate local regions. Moreover they uniformly downsample the input image which loses the rich color information and limits the learning of color transformation capabilities. In this paper we present a collaborative transformation framework (CoTF) for real-time exposure correction which integrates global transformation with pixel-wise transformations in an efficient manner. Specifically the global transformation adjusts the overall appearance using image-adaptive 3D LUTs to provide decent global contrast and sharp details while the pixel transformation compensates for local context. Then a relation-aware modulation module is designed to combine these two components effectively. In addition we propose an adaptive sampling strategy to preserve more color information by predicting the sampling intervals thus providing higher quality input data for the learning of 3D LUTs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can process high-resolution images in real-time on GPUs while achieving comparable performance against current state-of-the-art methods.

Lodge: A Coarse to Fine Diffusion Network for Long Dance Generation Guided by the Characteristic Dance Primitives,"Li, Ronghui, Zhang, YuXiang, Zhang, Yachao, Zhang, Hongwen, Guo, Jie, Zhang, Yan, Liu, Yebin, Li, Xiu",We propose Lodge a network capable of generating extremely long dance sequences conditioned on given music. We design Lodge as a two-stage coarse to fine diffusion architecture and propose the characteristic dance primitives that possess significant expressiveness as intermediate representations between two diffusion models. The first stage is global diffusion which focuses on comprehending the coarse-level music-dance correlation and production characteristic dance primitives. In contrast the second-stage is the local diffusion which parallelly generates detailed motion sequences under the guidance of the dance primitives and choreographic rules. In addition we propose a Foot Refine Block to optimize the contact between the feet and the ground enhancing the physical realism of the motion.

Transcending Forgery Specificity with Latent Space Augmentation for Generalizable Deepfake Detection,"Yan, Zhiyuan, Luo, Yuhao, Lyu, Siwei, Liu, Qingshan, Wu, Baoyuan",Deepfake detection faces a critical generalization hurdle with performance deteriorating when there is a mismatch between the distributions of training and testing data. A broadly received explanation is the tendency of these detectors to be overfitted to forgery-specific artifacts rather than learning features that are widely applicable across various forgeries. To address this issue we propose a simple yet effective detector called LSDA (\underline L atent \underline S pace \underline D ata \underline A ugmentation) which is based on a heuristic idea: representations with a wider variety of forgeries should be able to learn a more generalizable decision boundary thereby mitigating the overfitting of method-specific features (see Fig. 1). Following this idea we propose to enlarge the forgery space by constructing and simulating variations within and across forgery features in the latent space. This approach encompasses the acquisition of enriched domain-specific features and the facilitation of smoother transitions between different forgery types effectively bridging domain gaps. Our approach culminates in refining a binary classifier that leverages the distilled knowledge from the enhanced features striving for a generalizable deepfake detector. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method is surprisingly effective and transcends state-of-the-art detectors across several widely used benchmarks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yan_Transcending_Forgery_Specificity_with_Latent_Space_Augmentation_for_Generalizable_Deepfake_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Scaling Laws of Synthetic Images for Model Training ... for Now,"Fan, Lijie, Chen, Kaifeng, Krishnan, Dilip, Katabi, Dina, Isola, Phillip, Tian, Yonglong",Recent significant advances in text-to-image models unlock the possibility of training vision systems using synthetic images potentially overcoming the difficulty of collecting curated data at scale. It is unclear however how these models behave at scale as more synthetic data is added to the training set. In this paper we study the scaling laws of synthetic images generated by state of the art text-to-image models for the training of supervised models: image classifiers with label supervision and CLIP with language supervision. We identify several factors including text prompts classifier-free guidance scale and types of text-to-image models that significantly affect scaling behavior. After tuning these factors we observe that synthetic images demonstrate a scaling trend similar to but slightly less effective than real images in CLIP training while they significantly underperform in scaling when training supervised image classifiers. Our analysis indicates that the main reason for this underperformance is the inability of off-the-shelf text-to-image models to generate certain concepts a limitation that significantly impairs the training of image classifiers. Our findings also suggest that scaling synthetic data can be particularly effective in scenarios such as: (1) when there is a limited supply of real images for a supervised problem (e.g. fewer than 0.5 million images in ImageNet) (2) when the evaluation dataset diverges significantly from the training data indicating the out-of-distribution scenario or (3) when synthetic data is used in conjunction with real images as demonstrated in the training of CLIP models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Fan_Scaling_Laws_of_Synthetic_Images_for_Model_Training_..._for_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
State Space Models for Event Cameras,"Zubic, Nikola, Gehrig, Mathias, Scaramuzza, Davide",Today state-of-the-art deep neural networks that process event-camera data first convert a temporal window of events into dense grid-like input representations. As such they exhibit poor generalizability when deployed at higher inference frequencies (i.e. smaller temporal windows) than the ones they were trained on. We address this challenge by introducing state-space models (SSMs) with learnable timescale parameters to event-based vision. This design adapts to varying frequencies without the need to retrain the network at different frequencies. Additionally we investigate two strategies to counteract aliasing effects when deploying the model at higher frequencies. We comprehensively evaluate our approach against existing methods based on RNN and Transformer architectures across various benchmarks including Gen1 and 1 Mpx event camera datasets. Our results demonstrate that SSM-based models train 33% faster and also exhibit minimal performance degradation when tested at higher frequencies than the training input. Traditional RNN and Transformer models exhibit performance drops of more than 20 mAP with SSMs having a drop of 3.31 mAP highlighting the effectiveness of SSMs in event-based vision tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zubic_State_Space_Models_for_Event_Cameras_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
TeTriRF: Temporal Tri-Plane Radiance Fields for Efficient Free-Viewpoint Video,"Wu, Minye, Wang, Zehao, Kouros, Georgios, Tuytelaars, Tinne",Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) revolutionize the realm of visual media by providing photorealistic Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) experiences offering viewers unparalleled immersion and interactivity. However the technology's significant storage requirements and the computational complexity involved in generation and rendering currently limit its broader application. To close this gap this paper presents Temporal Tri-Plane Radiance Fields (TeTriRF) a novel technology that significantly reduces the storage size for Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) while maintaining low-cost generation and rendering. TeTriRF introduces a hybrid representation with tri-planes and voxel grids to support scaling up to long-duration sequences and scenes with complex motions or rapid changes. We propose a group training scheme tailored to achieving high training efficiency and yielding temporally consistent low-entropy scene representations on feature domain. Leveraging these properties of the representations we introduce a compression pipeline with off-the-shelf video codecs achieving an order of magnitude less storage size compared to the state-of-the-art. Our experiments demonstrate that TeTriRF can achieve competitive quality with a higher compression rate.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wu_TeTriRF_Temporal_Tri-Plane_Radiance_Fields_for_Efficient_Free-Viewpoint_Video_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Event-assisted Low-Light Video Object Segmentation,"Li, Hebei, Wang, Jin, Yuan, Jiahui, Li, Yue, Weng, Wenming, Peng, Yansong, Zhang, Yueyi, Xiong, Zhiwei, Sun, Xiaoyan",In the realm of video object segmentation (VOS) the challenge of operating under low-light conditions persists resulting in notably degraded image quality and compromised accuracy when comparing query and memory frames for similarity computation. Event cameras characterized by their high dynamic range and ability to capture motion information of objects offer promise in enhancing object visibility and aiding VOS methods under such low-light conditions. This paper introduces a pioneering framework tailored for low-light VOS leveraging event camera data to elevate segmentation accuracy. Our approach hinges on two pivotal components: the Adaptive Cross-Modal Fusion (ACMF) module aimed at extracting pertinent features while fusing image and event modalities to mitigate noise interference and the Event-Guided Memory Matching (EGMM) module designed to rectify the issue of inaccurate matching prevalent in low-light settings. Additionally we present the creation of a synthetic LLE-DAVIS dataset and the curation of a real-world LLE-VOS dataset encompassing frames and events. Experimental evaluations corroborate the efficacy of our method across both datasets affirming its effectiveness in low-light scenarios.

VidToMe: Video Token Merging for Zero-Shot Video Editing,"Li, Xirui, Ma, Chao, Yang, Xiaokang, Yang, Ming-Hsuan",Diffusion models have made significant advances in generating high-quality images but their application to video generation has remained challenging due to the complexity of temporal motion. Zero-shot video editing offers a solution by utilizing pre-trained image diffusion models to translate source videos into new ones. Nevertheless existing methods struggle to maintain strict temporal consistency and efficient memory consumption. In this work we propose a novel approach to enhance temporal consistency in generated videos by merging self-attention tokens across frames. By aligning and compressing temporally redundant tokens across frames our method improves temporal coherence and reduces memory consumption in self-attention computations. The merging strategy matches and aligns tokens according to the temporal correspondence between frames facilitating natural temporal consistency in generated video frames. To manage the complexity of video processing we divide videos into chunks and develop intra-chunk local token merging and inter-chunk global token merging ensuring both short-term video continuity and long-term content consistency. Our video editing approach seamlessly extends the advancements in image editing to video editing rendering favorable results in temporal consistency over state-of-the-art methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_VidToMe_Video_Token_Merging_for_Zero-Shot_Video_Editing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FaceChain-SuDe: Building Derived Class to Inherit Category Attributes for One-shot Subject-Driven Generation,"Qiao, Pengchong, Shang, Lei, Liu, Chang, Sun, Baigui, Ji, Xiangyang, Chen, Jie",Recently subject-driven generation has garnered significant interest due to its ability to personalize text-to-image generation. Typical works focus on learning the new subject's private attributes. However an important fact has not been taken seriously that a subject is not an isolated new concept but should be a specialization of a certain category in the pre-trained model. This results in the subject failing to comprehensively inherit the attributes in its category causing poor attribute-related generations. In this paper motivated by object-oriented programming we model the subject as a derived class whose base class is its semantic category. This modeling enables the subject to inherit public attributes from its category while learning its private attributes from the user-provided example. Specifically we propose a plug-and-play method Subject-Derived regularization (SuDe). It constructs the base-derived class modeling by constraining the subject-driven generated images to semantically belong to the subject's category. Extensive experiments under three baselines and two backbones on various subjects show that our SuDe enables imaginative attribute-related generations while maintaining subject fidelity.

StableVITON: Learning Semantic Correspondence with Latent Diffusion Model for Virtual Try-On,"Kim, Jeongho, Gu, Guojung, Park, Minho, Park, Sunghyun, Choo, Jaegul",Given a clothing image and a person image an image-based virtual try-on aims to generate a customized image that appears natural and accurately reflects the characteristics of the clothing image. In this work we aim to expand the applicability of the pre-trained diffusion model so that it can be utilized independently for the virtual try-on task. The main challenge is to preserve the clothing details while effectively utilizing the robust generative capability of the pre-trained model. In order to tackle these issues we propose StableVITON learning the semantic correspondence between the clothing and the human body within the latent space of the pre-trained diffusion model in an end-to-end manner. Our proposed zero cross-attention blocks not only preserve the clothing details by learning the semantic correspondence but also generate high-fidelity images by utilizing the inherent knowledge of the pre-trained model in the warping process. Through our proposed novel attention total variation loss and applying augmentation we achieve the sharp attention map resulting in a more precise representation of clothing details. StableVITON outperforms the baselines in qualitative and quantitative evaluation showing promising quality in arbitrary person images. Our code is available at https://github.com/rlawjdghek/StableVITON.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kim_StableVITON_Learning_Semantic_Correspondence_with_Latent_Diffusion_Model_for_Virtual_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Make-Your-Anchor: A Diffusion-based 2D Avatar Generation Framework,"Huang, Ziyao, Tang, Fan, Zhang, Yong, Cun, Xiaodong, Cao, Juan, Li, Jintao, Lee, Tong-Yee",Despite the remarkable process of talking-head-based avatar-creating solutions directly generating anchor-style videos with full-body motions remains challenging. In this study we propose Make-Your-Anchor a novel system necessitating only a one-minute video clip of an individual for training subsequently enabling the automatic generation of anchor-style videos with precise torso and hand movements. Specifically we finetune a proposed structure-guided diffusion model on input video to render 3D mesh conditions into human appearances. We adopt a two-stage training strategy for the diffusion model effectively binding movements with specific appearances. To produce arbitrary long temporal video we extend the 2D U-Net in the frame-wise diffusion model to a 3D style without additional training cost and a simple yet effective batch-overlapped temporal denoising module is proposed to bypass the constraints on video length during inference. Finally a novel identity-specific face enhancement module is introduced to improve the visual quality of facial regions in the output videos. Comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the system in terms of visual quality temporal coherence and identity preservation outperforming SOTA diffusion/non-diffusion methods.

Learning Dynamic Tetrahedra for High-Quality Talking Head Synthesis,"Zhang, Zicheng, Zheng, Ruobing, Li, Bonan, Han, Congying, Li, Tianqi, Wang, Meng, Guo, Tiande, Chen, Jingdong, Liu, Ziwen, Yang, Ming",Recent works in implicit representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced the generation of realistic and animatable head avatars from video sequences. These implicit methods are still confronted by visual artifacts and jitters since the lack of explicit geometric constraints poses a fundamental challenge in accurately modeling complex facial deformations. In this paper we introduce Dynamic Tetrahedra (DynTet) a novel hybrid representation that encodes explicit dynamic meshes by neural networks to ensure geometric consistency across various motions and viewpoints. DynTet is parameterized by the coordinate-based networks which learn signed distance deformation and material texture anchoring the training data into a predefined tetrahedra grid. Leveraging Marching Tetrahedra DynTet efficiently decodes textured meshes with a consistent topology enabling fast rendering through a differentiable rasterizer and supervision via a pixel loss. To enhance training efficiency we incorporate classical 3D Morphable Models to facilitate geometry learning and define a canonical space for simplifying texture learning. These advantages are readily achievable owing to the effective geometric representation employed in DynTet. Compared with prior works DynTet demonstrates significant improvements in fidelity lip synchronization and real-time performance according to various metrics. Beyond producing stable and visually appealing synthesis videos our method also outputs the dynamic meshes which is promising to enable many emerging applications.

3D Geometry-Aware Deformable Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic View Synthesis,"Lu, Zhicheng, Guo, Xiang, Hui, Le, Chen, Tianrui, Yang, Min, Tang, Xiao, Zhu, Feng, Dai, Yuchao",In this paper we propose a 3D geometry-aware deformable Gaussian Splatting method for dynamic view synthesis. Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) based solutions learn the deformation in an implicit manner which cannot incorporate 3D scene geometry. Therefore the learned deformation is not necessarily geometrically coherent which results in unsatisfactory dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new representation of the 3D scene building upon which the 3D geometry could be exploited in learning the complex 3D deformation. Specifically the scenes are represented as a collection of 3D Gaussian where each 3D Gaussian is optimized to move and rotate over time to model the deformation. To enforce the 3D scene geometry constraint during deformation we explicitly extract 3D geometry features and integrate them in learning the 3D deformation. In this way our solution achieves 3D geometry-aware deformation modeling which enables improved dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets prove the superiority of our solution which achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Person-in-WiFi 3D: End-to-End Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation with Wi-Fi,"Yan, Kangwei, Wang, Fei, Qian, Bo, Ding, Han, Han, Jinsong, Wei, Xing",Wi-Fi signals in contrast to cameras offer privacy protection and occlusion resilience for some practical scenarios such as smart homes elderly care and virtual reality. Recent years have seen remarkable progress in the estimation of single-person 2D pose single-person 3D pose and multi-person 2D pose. This paper takes a step forward by introducing Person-in-WiFi 3D a pioneering Wi-Fi system that accomplishes multi-person 3D pose estimation. Person-in-WiFi 3D has two main updates. Firstly it has a greater number of Wi-Fi devices to enhance the capability for capturing spatial reflections from multiple individuals. Secondly it leverages the Transformer for end-to-end estimation. Compared to its predecessor Person-in-WiFi 3D is storage-efficient and fast. We deployed a proof-of-concept system in 4mx3.5m areas and collected a dataset of over 97K frames with seven volunteers. Person-in-WiFi 3D attains 3D joint localization errors of 91.7mm (1-person) 108.1mm (2-person) and 125.3mm (3-person) comparable to cameras and millimeter-wave radars.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yan_Person-in-WiFi_3D_End-to-End_Multi-Person_3D_Pose_Estimation_with_Wi-Fi_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Fairy: Fast Parallelized Instruction-Guided Video-to-Video Synthesis,"Wu, Bichen, Chuang, Ching-Yao, Wang, Xiaoyan, Jia, Yichen, Krishnakumar, Kapil, Xiao, Tong, Liang, Feng, Yu, Licheng, Vajda, Peter",In this paper we introduce Fairy a minimalist yet robust adaptation of image-editing diffusion models enhancing them for video editing applications. Our approach centers on the concept of anchor-based cross-frame attention a mechanism that implicitly propagates diffusion features across frames ensuring superior temporal coherence and high-fidelity synthesis. Fairy not only addresses limitations of previous models including memory and processing speed. It also improves temporal consistency through a unique data augmentation strategy. This strategy renders the model equivariant to affine transformations in both source and target images. Remarkably efficient Fairy generates 120-frame 512x384 videos (4-second duration at 30 FPS) in just 14 seconds outpacing prior works by at least 44x. A comprehensive user study involving 1000 generated samples confirms that our approach delivers superior quality decisively outperforming established methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wu_Fairy_Fast_Parallelized_Instruction-Guided_Video-to-Video_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SmartEdit: Exploring Complex Instruction-based Image Editing with Multimodal Large Language Models,"Huang, Yuzhou, Xie, Liangbin, Wang, Xintao, Yuan, Ziyang, Cun, Xiaodong, Ge, Yixiao, Zhou, Jiantao, Dong, Chao, Huang, Rui, Zhang, Ruimao, Shan, Ying",Current instruction-based image editing methods such as InstructPix2Pix often fail to produce satisfactory results in complex scenarios due to their dependence on the simple CLIP text encoder in diffusion models. To rectify this this paper introduces SmartEdit a novel approach of instruction-based image editing that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance its understanding and reasoning capabilities. However direct integration of these elements still faces challenges in situations requiring complex reasoning. To mitigate this we propose a Bidirectional Interaction Module (BIM) that enables comprehensive bidirectional information interactions between the input image and the MLLM output. During training we initially incorporate perception data to boost the perception and understanding capabilities of diffusion models. Subsequently we demonstrate that a small amount of complex instruction editing data can effectively stimulate SmartEdit's editing capabilities for more complex instructions. We further construct a new evaluation dataset Reason-Edit specifically tailored for complex instruction-based image editing. Both quantitative and qualitative results on this evaluation dataset indicate that our SmartEdit surpasses previous methods paving the way for the practical application of complex instruction-based image editing.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Huang_SmartEdit_Exploring_Complex_Instruction-based_Image_Editing_with_Multimodal_Large_Language_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
It's All About Your Sketch: Democratising Sketch Control in Diffusion Models,"Koley, Subhadeep, Bhunia, Ayan Kumar, Sekhri, Deeptanshu, Sain, Aneeshan, Chowdhury, Pinaki Nath, Xiang, Tao, Song, Yi-Zhe","This paper unravels the potential of sketches for diffusion models addressing the deceptive promise of direct sketch control in generative AI. We importantly democratise the process enabling amateur sketches to generate precise images living up to the commitment of ""what you sketch is what you get"". A pilot study underscores the necessity revealing that deformities in existing models stem from spatial-conditioning. To rectify this we propose an abstraction-aware framework utilising a sketch adapter adaptive time-step sampling and discriminative guidance from a pre-trained fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval model working synergistically to reinforce fine-grained sketch-photo association. Our approach operates seamlessly during inference without the need for textual prompts; a simple rough sketch akin to what you and I can create suffices!

When StyleGAN Meets Stable Diffusion: a W+ Adapter for Personalized Image Generation,"Li, Xiaoming, Hou, Xinyu, Loy, Chen Change",Text-to-image diffusion models have remarkably excelled in producing diverse high-quality and photo-realistic images. This advancement has spurred a growing interest in incorporating specific identities into generated content. Most current methods employ an inversion approach to embed a target visual concept into the text embedding space using a single reference image. However the newly synthesized faces either closely resemble the reference image in terms of facial attributes such as expression or exhibit a reduced capacity for identity preservation. Text descriptions intended to guide the facial attributes of the synthesized face may fall short owing to the intricate entanglement of identity information with identity-irrelevant facial attributes derived from the reference image. To address these issues we present the novel use of the extended StyleGAN embedding space \mathcal W _+ to achieve enhanced identity preservation and disentanglement for diffusion models. By aligning this semantically meaningful human face latent space with text-to-image diffusion models we succeed in maintaining high fidelity in identity preservation coupled with the capacity for semantic editing. Additionally we propose new training objectives to balance the influences of both prompt and identity conditions ensuring that the identity-irrelevant background remains \lxm negligibly affected  during facial attribute modifications. Extensive experiments reveal that our method adeptly generates personalized text-to-image outputs that are not only compatible with prompt descriptions but also amenable to common StyleGAN editing directions in diverse settings.

CAM Back Again: Large Kernel CNNs from a Weakly Supervised Object Localization Perspective,"Yasuki, Shunsuke, Taki, Masato",Recently convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with large size kernels have attracted much attention in the computer vision field following the success of the Vision Transformers. Large kernel CNNs have been reported to perform well in downstream vision tasks as well as in classification performance. The reason for the high-performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream tasks has been attributed to the large effective receptive field (ERF) produced by large size kernels but this view has not been fully tested. We therefore revisit the performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream task focusing on the weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) task. WSOL a difficult downstream task that is not fully supervised provides a new angle to explore the capabilities of the large kernel CNNs. Our study compares the modern large kernel CNNs ConvNeXt RepLKNet and SLaK to test the validity of the naive expectation that ERF size is important for improving downstream task performance. Our analysis of the factors contributing to high performance provides a different perspective in which the main factor is feature map improvement. Furthermore we find that modern CNNs are robust to the CAM problems of local regions of objects being activated which has long been discussed in WSOL. CAM is the most classic WSOL method but because of the above-mentioned problems it is often used as a baseline method for comparison. However experiments on the CUB-200-2011 dataset show that simply combining a large kernel CNN CAM and simple data augmentation methods can achieve performance (90.99% MaxBoxAcc) comparable to the latest WSOL method which is CNN-based and requires special training or complex post-processing.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yasuki_CAM_Back_Again_Large_Kernel_CNNs_from_a_Weakly_Supervised_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Putting the Object Back into Video Object Segmentation,"Cheng, Ho Kei, Oh, Seoung Wug, Price, Brian, Lee, Joon-Young, Schwing, Alexander",We present Cutie a video object segmentation (VOS) network with object-level memory reading which puts the object representation from memory back into the video object segmentation result. Recent works on VOS employ bottom-up pixel-level memory reading which struggles due to matching noise especially in the presence of distractors resulting in lower performance in more challenging data. In contrast Cutie performs top-down object-level memory reading by adapting a small set of object queries. Via those it interacts with the bottom-up pixel features iteratively with a query-based object transformer (qt hence Cutie). The object queries act as a high-level summary of the target object while high-resolution feature maps are retained for accurate segmentation. Together with foreground-background masked attention Cutie cleanly separates the semantics of the foreground object from the background. On the challenging MOSE dataset Cutie improves by 8.7 J&F over XMem with a similar running time and improves by 4.2 J&F over DeAOT while being three times faster.

Concept Weaver: Enabling Multi-Concept Fusion in Text-to-Image Models,"Kwon, Gihyun, Jenni, Simon, Li, Dingzeyu, Lee, Joon-Young, Ye, Jong Chul, Heilbron, Fabian Caba",While there has been significant progress in customizing text-to-image generation models generating images that combine multiple personalized concepts remains challenging. In this work we introduce Concept Weaver a method for composing customized text-to-image diffusion models at inference time. Specifically the method breaks the process into two steps: creating a template image aligned with the semantics of input prompts and then personalizing the template using a concept fusion strategy. The fusion strategy incorporates the appearance of the target concepts into the template image while retaining its structural details. The results indicate that our method can generate multiple custom concepts with higher identity fidelity compared to alternative approaches. Furthermore the method is shown to seamlessly handle more than two concepts and closely follow the semantic meaning of the input prompt without blending appearances across different subjects.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kwon_Concept_Weaver_Enabling_Multi-Concept_Fusion_in_Text-to-Image_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation via Iterative Support-Query Correspondence Mining,"Nie, Jiahao, Xing, Yun, Zhang, Gongjie, Yan, Pei, Xiao, Aoran, Tan, Yap-Peng, Kot, Alex C., Lu, Shijian",Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) poses the challenge of segmenting novel categories from a distinct domain using only limited exemplars. In this paper we undertake a comprehensive study of CD-FSS and uncover two crucial insights: (i) the necessity of a fine-tuning stage to effectively transfer the learned meta-knowledge across domains and (ii) the overfitting risk during the naive fine-tuning due to the scarcity of novel category examples. With these insights we propose a novel cross-domain fine-tuning strategy that addresses the challenging CD-FSS tasks. We first design Bi-directional Few-shot Prediction (BFP) which establishes support-query correspondence in a bi-directional manner crafting augmented supervision to reduce the overfitting risk. Then we further extend BFP into Iterative Few-shot Adaptor (IFA) which is a recursive framework to capture the support-query correspondence iteratively targeting maximal exploitation of supervisory signals from the sparse novel category samples. Extensive empirical evaluations show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts (+7.8%) which verifies that IFA tackles the cross-domain challenges and mitigates the overfitting simultaneously.

DiffSHEG: A Diffusion-Based Approach for Real-Time Speech-driven Holistic 3D Expression and Gesture Generation,"Chen, Junming, Liu, Yunfei, Wang, Jianan, Zeng, Ailing, Li, Yu, Chen, Qifeng",We propose DiffSHEG a Diffusion-based approach for Speech-driven Holistic 3D Expression and Gesture generation. While previous works focused on co-speech gesture or expression generation individually the joint generation of synchronized expressions and gestures remains barely explored. To address this our diffusion-based co-speech motion generation Transformer enables uni-directional information flow from expression to gesture facilitating improved matching of joint expression-gesture distributions. Furthermore we introduce an outpainting-based sampling strategy for arbitrary long sequence generation in diffusion models offering flexibility and computational efficiency. Our method provides a practical solution that produces high-quality synchronized expression and gesture generation driven by speech. Evaluated on two public datasets our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally a user study confirms the superiority of our method over prior approaches. By enabling the real-time generation of expressive and synchronized motions our method showcases its potential for various applications in the development of digital humans and embodied agents.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_DiffSHEG_A_Diffusion-Based_Approach_for_Real-Time_Speech-driven_Holistic_3D_Expression_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

DIRECT-3D: Learning Direct Text-to-3D Generation on Massive Noisy 3D Data,"Liu, Qihao, Zhang, Yi, Bai, Song, Kortylewski, Adam, Yuille, Alan",We present DIRECT-3D a diffusion-based 3D generative model for creating high-quality 3D assets (represented by Neural Radiance Fields) from text prompts. Unlike recent 3D generative models that rely on clean and well-aligned 3D data limiting them to single or few-class generation our model is directly trained on extensive noisy and unaligned `in-the-wild' 3D assets mitigating the key challenge (i.e. data scarcity) in large-scale 3D generation. In particular DIRECT-3D is a tri-plane diffusion model that integrates two innovations: 1) A novel learning framework where noisy data are filtered and aligned automatically during the training process. Specifically after an initial warm-up phase using a small set of clean data an iterative optimization is introduced in the diffusion process to explicitly estimate the 3D pose of objects and select beneficial data based on conditional density. 2) An efficient 3D representation that is achieved by disentangling object geometry and color features with two separate conditional diffusion models that are optimized hierarchically. Given a prompt input our model generates high-quality high-resolution realistic and complex 3D objects with accurate geometric details in seconds. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in both single-class generation and text-to-3D generation. We also demonstrate that DIRECT-3D can serve as a useful 3D geometric prior of objects for example to alleviate the well-known Janus problem in 2D-lifting methods such as DreamFusion.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_DIRECT-3D_Learning_Direct_Text-to-3D_Generation_on_Massive_Noisy_3D_Data_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
OHTA: One-shot Hand Avatar via Data-driven Implicit Priors,"Zheng, Xiaozheng, Wen, Chao, Su, Zhuo, Xu, Zeran, Li, Zhaohu, Zhao, Yang, Xue, Zhou",In this paper we delve into the creation of one-shot hand avatars attaining high-fidelity and drivable hand representations swiftly from a single image. With the burgeoning domains of the digital human the need for quick and personalized hand avatar creation has become increasingly critical. Existing techniques typically require extensive input data and may prove cumbersome or even impractical in certain scenarios. To enhance accessibility we present a novel method OHTA (One-shot Hand avaTAr) that enables the creation of detailed hand avatars from merely one image. OHTA tackles the inherent difficulties of this data-limited problem by learning and utilizing data-driven hand priors. Specifically we design a hand prior model initially employed for 1) learning various hand priors with available data and subsequently for 2) the inversion and fitting of the target identity with prior knowledge. OHTA demonstrates the capability to create high-fidelity hand avatars with consistent animatable quality solely relying on a single image. Furthermore we illustrate the versatility of OHTA through diverse applications encompassing text-to-avatar conversion hand editing and identity latent space manipulation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zheng_OHTA_One-shot_Hand_Avatar_via_Data-driven_Implicit_Priors_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Human Motion Prediction Under Unexpected Perturbation,"Yue, Jiangbei, Li, Baiyi, Pettr√©, Julien, Seyfried, Armin, Wang, He",We investigate a new task in human motion prediction which is predicting motions under unexpected physical perturbation potentially involving multiple people. Compared with existing research this task involves predicting less controlled unpremeditated and pure reactive motions in response to external impact and how such motions can propagate through people. It brings new challenges such as data scarcity and predicting complex interactions. To this end we propose a new method capitalizing differentiable physics and deep neural networks leading to an explicit Latent Differentiable Physics (LDP) model. Through experiments we demonstrate that LDP has high data efficiency outstanding prediction accuracy strong generalizability and good explainability. Since there is no similar research a comprehensive comparison with 11 adapted baselines from several relevant domains is conducted showing LDP outperforming existing research both quantitatively and qualitatively improving prediction accuracy by as much as 70% and demonstrating significantly stronger generalization.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yue_Human_Motion_Prediction_Under_Unexpected_Perturbation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Text-to-3D Generation with Bidirectional Diffusion using both 2D and 3D priors,"Ding, Lihe, Dong, Shaocong, Huang, Zhanpeng, Wang, Zibin, Zhang, Yiyuan, Gong, Kaixiong, Xu, Dan, Xue, Tianfan",Most 3D generation research focuses on up-projecting 2D foundation models into the 3D space either by minimizing 2D Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss or fine-tuning on multi-view datasets. Without explicit 3D priors these methods often lead to geometric anomalies and multi-view inconsistency. Recently researchers have attempted to improve the genuineness of 3D objects by directly training on 3D datasets albeit at the cost of low-quality texture generation due to the limited texture diversity in 3D datasets. To harness the advantages of both approaches we propose Bidirectional Diffusion (BiDiff) a unified framework that incorporates both a 3D and a 2D diffusion process to preserve both 3D fidelity and 2D texture richness respectively. Moreover as a simple combination may yield inconsistent generation results we further bridge them with novel bidirectional guidance. In addition our method can be used as an initialization of optimization-based models to further improve the quality of 3D model and efficiency of optimization reducing the process from 3.4 hours to 20 minutes. Experimental results have shown that our model achieves high-quality diverse and scalable 3D generation.

Make-It-Vivid: Dressing Your Animatable Biped Cartoon Characters from Text,"Tang, Junshu, Zeng, Yanhong, Fan, Ke, Wang, Xuheng, Dai, Bo, Chen, Kai, Ma, Lizhuang",Creating and animating 3D biped cartoon characters is crucial and valuable in various applications. Compared with geometry the diverse texture design plays an important role in making 3D biped cartoon characters vivid and charming. Therefore we focus on automatic texture design for cartoon characters based on input instructions. This is challenging for domain-specific requirements and a lack of high-quality data. To address this challenge we propose Make-It-Vivid the first attempt to enable high-quality texture generation from text in UV space. We prepare a detailed text-texture paired data for 3D characters by using vision-question-answering agents. Then we customize a pretrained text-to-image model to generate texture map with template structure while preserving the natural 2D image knowledge. Furthermore to enhance fine-grained details we propose a novel adversarial learning scheme to shorten the domain gap between original dataset and realistic texture domain. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms current texture generation methods resulting in efficient character texturing and faithful generation with prompts. Besides we showcase various applications such as out of domain generation and texture stylization. We also provide an efficient generation system for automatic text-guided textured character generation and animation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Tang_Make-It-Vivid_Dressing_Your_Animatable_Biped_Cartoon_Characters_from_Text_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Neural Sign Actors: A Diffusion Model for 3D Sign Language Production from Text,"Baltatzis, Vasileios, Potamias, Rolandos Alexandros, Ververas, Evangelos, Sun, Guanxiong, Deng, Jiankang, Zafeiriou, Stefanos",Sign Languages (SL) serve as the primary mode of communication for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities. Deep learning methods for SL recognition and translation have achieved promising results. However Sign Language Production (SLP) poses a challenge as the generated motions must be realistic and have precise semantic meaning. Most SLP methods rely on 2D data which hinders their realism. In this work a diffusion-based SLP model is trained on a curated large-scale dataset of 4D signing avatars and their corresponding text transcripts. The proposed method can generate dynamic sequences of 3D avatars from an unconstrained domain of discourse using a diffusion process formed on a novel and anatomically informed graph neural network defined on the SMPL-X body skeleton. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments we show that the proposed method considerably outperforms previous methods of SLP.

On the Diversity and Realism of Distilled Dataset: An Efficient Dataset Distillation Paradigm,"Sun, Peng, Shi, Bei, Yu, Daiwei, Lin, Tao",Contemporary machine learning which involves training large neural networks on massive datasets faces significant computational challenges. Dataset distillation as a recent emerging strategy aims to compress real-world datasets for efficient training. However this line of research currently struggles with large-scale and high-resolution datasets hindering its practicality and feasibility. Thus we re-examine existing methods and identify three properties essential for real-world applications: realism diversity and efficiency. As a remedy we propose RDED a novel computationally-efficient yet effective data distillation paradigm to enable both diversity and realism of the distilled data. Extensive empirical results over various model architectures and datasets demonstrate the advancement of RDED: we can distill a dataset to 10 images per class from full ImageNet-1K within 7 minutes achieving a notable 42% accuracy with ResNet-18 on a single RTX-4090 GPU (while the SOTA only achieves 21% but requires 6 hours).

Semantics-aware Motion Retargeting with Vision-Language Models,"Zhang, Haodong, Chen, Zhike, Xu, Haocheng, Hao, Lei, Wu, Xiaofei, Xu, Songcen, Zhang, Zhensong, Wang, Yue, Xiong, Rong",Capturing and preserving motion semantics is essential to motion retargeting between animation characters. However most of the previous works neglect the semantic information or rely on human-designed joint-level representations. Here we present a novel Semantics-aware Motion reTargeting (SMT) method with the advantage of vision-language models to extract and maintain meaningful motion semantics. We utilize a differentiable module to render 3D motions. Then the high-level motion semantics are incorporated into the motion retargeting process by feeding the vision-language model with the rendered images and aligning the extracted semantic embeddings. To ensure the preservation of fine-grained motion details and high-level semantics we adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of skeleton-aware pre-training and fine-tuning with semantics and geometry constraints. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in producing high-quality motion retargeting results while accurately preserving motion semantics.

Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation Through Depth-Guided Feature Correlation and Sampling,"Sick, Leon, Engel, Dominik, Hermosilla, Pedro, Ropinski, Timo",Traditionally training neural networks to perform semantic segmentation requires expensive human-made annotations. But more recently advances in the field of unsupervised learning have made significant progress on this issue and towards closing the gap to supervised algorithms. To achieve this semantic knowledge is distilled by learning to correlate randomly sampled features from images across an entire dataset. In this work we build upon these advances by incorporating information about the structure of the scene into the training process through the use of depth information. We achieve this by (1) learning depth-feature correlation by spatially correlating the feature maps with the depth maps to induce knowledge about the structure of the scene and (2) exploiting farthest-point sampling to more effectively select relevant features by utilizing 3D sampling techniques on depth information of the scene. Finally we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical contributions through extensive experimentation and present significant improvements in performance across multiple benchmark datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sick_Unsupervised_Semantic_Segmentation_Through_Depth-Guided_Feature_Correlation_and_Sampling_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
RAVE: Randomized Noise Shuffling for Fast and Consistent Video Editing with Diffusion Models,"Kara, Ozgur, Kurtkaya, Bariscan, Yesiltepe, Hidir, Rehg, James M., Yanardag, Pinar",Recent advancements in diffusion-based models have demonstrated significant success in generating images from text. However video editing models have not yet reached the same level of visual quality and user control. To address this we introduce RAVE a zero-shot video editing method that leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models without additional training. RAVE takes an input video and a text prompt to produce high-quality videos while preserving the original motion and semantic structure. It employs a novel noise shuffling strategy leveraging spatio-temporal interactions between frames to produce temporally consistent videos faster than existing methods. It is also efficient in terms of memory requirements allowing it to handle longer videos. RAVE is capable of a wide range of edits from local attribute modifications to shape transformations. In order to demonstrate the versatility of RAVE we create a comprehensive video evaluation dataset ranging from object-focused scenes to complex human activities like dancing and typing and dynamic scenes featuring swimming fish and boats. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments highlight the effectiveness of RAVE in diverse video editing scenarios compared to existing methods. Our code dataset and videos can be found in \href https://rave-video-edit.github.io/.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kara_RAVE_Randomized_Noise_Shuffling_for_Fast_and_Consistent_Video_Editing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Video-Based Human Pose Regression via Decoupled Space-Time Aggregation,"He, Jijie, Yang, Wenwu",By leveraging temporal dependency in video sequences multi-frame human pose estimation algorithms have demonstrated remarkable results in complicated situations such as occlusion motion blur and video defocus. These algorithms are predominantly based on heatmaps resulting in high computation and storage requirements per frame which limits their flexibility and real-time application in video scenarios particularly on edge devices. In this paper we develop an efficient and effective video-based human pose regression method which bypasses intermediate representations such as heatmaps and instead directly maps the input to the output joint coordinates. Despite the inherent spatial correlation among adjacent joints of the human pose the temporal trajectory of each individual joint exhibits relative independence. In light of this we propose a novel Decoupled Space-Time Aggregation network (DSTA) to separately capture the spatial contexts between adjacent joints and the temporal cues of each individual joint thereby avoiding the conflation of spatiotemporal dimensions. Concretely DSTA learns a dedicated feature token for each joint to facilitate the modeling of their spatiotemporal dependencies. With the proposed joint-wise local-awareness attention mechanism our method is capable of efficiently and flexibly utilizing the spatial dependency of adjacent joints and the temporal dependency of each joint itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared to previous regression-based single-frame human pose estimation methods DSTA significantly enhances performance achieving an 8.9 mAP improvement on PoseTrack2017. Furthermore our approach either surpasses or is on par with the state-of-the-art heatmap-based multi-frame human pose estimation methods.

L-MAGIC: Language Model Assisted Generation of Images with Coherence,"Cai, Zhipeng, Mueller, Matthias, Birkl, Reiner, Wofk, Diana, Tseng, Shao-Yen, Cheng, Junda, Stan, Gabriela Ben-Melech, Lai, Vasudev, Paulitsch, Michael",In the current era of generative AI breakthroughs generating panoramic scenes from a single input image remains a key challenge. Most existing methods use diffusion-based iterative or simultaneous multi-view inpainting. However the lack of global scene layout priors leads to subpar outputs with duplicated objects (e.g. multiple beds in a bedroom) or requires time-consuming human text inputs for each view. We propose L-MAGIC a novel method leveraging large language models for guidance while diffusing multiple coherent views of 360 degree panoramic scenes. L-MAGIC harnesses pre-trained diffusion and language models without fine-tuning ensuring zero-shot performance. The output quality is further enhanced by super-resolution and multi-view fusion techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting panoramic scenes feature better scene layouts and perspective view rendering quality compared to related works with >70% preference in human evaluations. Combined with conditional diffusion models L-MAGIC can accept various input modalities including but not limited to text depth maps sketches and colored scripts. Applying depth estimation further enables 3D point cloud generation and dynamic scene exploration with fluid camera motion.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cai_L-MAGIC_Language_Model_Assisted_Generation_of_Images_with_Coherence_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
3D Face Tracking from 2D Video through Iterative Dense UV to Image Flow,"Taubner, Felix, Raina, Prashant, Tuli, Mathieu, Teh, Eu Wern, Lee, Chul, Huang, Jinmiao",When working with 3D facial data improving fidelity and avoiding the uncanny valley effect is critically dependent on accurate 3D facial performance capture. Because such methods are expensive and due to the widespread availability of 2D videos recent methods have focused on how to perform monocular 3D face tracking. However these methods often fall short in capturing precise facial movements due to limitations in their network architecture training and evaluation processes. Addressing these challenges we propose a novel face tracker FlowFace that introduces an innovative 2D alignment network for dense per-vertex alignment. Unlike prior work FlowFace is trained on high-quality 3D scan annotations rather than weak supervision or synthetic data. Our 3D model fitting module jointly fits a 3D face model from one or many observations integrating existing neutral shape priors for enhanced identity and expression disentanglement and per-vertex deformations for detailed facial feature reconstruction. Additionally we propose a novel metric and benchmark for assessing tracking accuracy. Our method exhibits superior performance on both custom and publicly available benchmarks. We further validate the effectiveness of our tracker by generating high-quality 3D data from 2D videos which leads to performance gains on downstream tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Taubner_3D_Face_Tracking_from_2D_Video_through_Iterative_Dense_UV_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Carve3D: Improving Multi-view Reconstruction Consistency for Diffusion Models with RL Finetuning,"Xie, Desai, Li, Jiahao, Tan, Hao, Sun, Xin, Shu, Zhixin, Zhou, Yi, Bi, Sai, Pirk, S√∂ren, Kaufman, Arie E.",Multi-view diffusion models obtained by applying Supervised Finetuning (SFT) to text-to-image diffusion models have driven recent breakthroughs in text-to-3D research. However due to the limited size and quality of existing 3D datasets they still suffer from multi-view inconsistencies and Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) reconstruction artifacts. We argue that multi-view diffusion models can benefit from further Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RLFT) which allows models to learn from the data generated by themselves and improve beyond their dataset limitations during SFT. To this end we introduce Carve3D an improved RLFT algorithm coupled with a novel Multi-view Reconstruction Consistency (MRC) metric to enhance the consistency of multi-view diffusion models. To measure the MRC metric on a set of multi-view images we compare them with their corresponding NeRF renderings at the same camera viewpoints. The resulting model which we denote as Carve3DM demonstrates superior multi-view consistency and NeRF reconstruction quality than existing models. Our results suggest that pairing SFT with Carve3D's RLFT is essential for developing multi-view-consistent diffusion models mirroring the standard Large Language Model (LLM) alignment pipeline. Our code training and testing data and video results are available at: https://desaixie.github.io/carve-3d.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xie_Carve3D_Improving_Multi-view_Reconstruction_Consistency_for_Diffusion_Models_with_RL_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Shadow Generation for Composite Image Using Diffusion Model,"Liu, Qingyang, You, Junqi, Wang, Jianting, Tao, Xinhao, Zhang, Bo, Niu, Li",In the realm of image composition generating realistic shadow for the inserted foreground remains a formidable challenge. Previous works have developed image-to-image translation models which are trained on paired training data. However they are struggling to generate shadows with accurate shapes and intensities hindered by data scarcity and inherent task complexity. In this paper we resort to foundation model with rich prior knowledge of natural shadow images. Specifically we first adapt ControlNet to our task and then propose intensity modulation modules to improve the shadow intensity. Moreover we extend the small-scale DESOBA dataset to DESOBAv2 using a novel data acquisition pipeline. Experimental results on both DESOBA and DESOBAv2 datasets as well as real composite images demonstrate the superior capability of our model for shadow generation task. The dataset code and model are released at https://github.com/bcmi/Object-Shadow-Generation-Dataset-DESOBAv2.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Shadow_Generation_for_Composite_Image_Using_Diffusion_Model_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DisCo: Disentangled Control for Realistic Human Dance Generation,"Wang, Tan, Li, Linjie, Lin, Kevin, Zhai, Yuanhao, Lin, Chung-Ching, Yang, Zhengyuan, Zhang, Hanwang, Liu, Zicheng, Wang, Lijuan",Generative AI has made significant strides in computer vision particularly in text-driven image/video synthesis (T2I/T2V). Despite the notable advancements it remains challenging in human-centric content synthesis such as realistic dance generation. Current methodologies primarily tailored for human motion transfer encounter difficulties when confronted with real-world dance scenarios (e.g. social media dance) which require to generalize across a wide spectrum of poses and intricate human details. In this paper we depart from the traditional paradigm of human motion transfer and emphasize two additional critical attributes for the synthesis of human dance content in social media contexts: (i) Generalizability: the model should be able to generalize beyond generic human viewpoints as well as unseen human subjects backgrounds and poses; (ii) Compositionality: it should allow for the seamless composition of seen/unseen subjects backgrounds and poses from different sources. To address these challenges we introduce DISCO which includes a novel model architecture with disentangled control to improve the compositionality of dance synthesis and an effective human attribute pre-training for better generalizability to unseen humans. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that DISCO can generate high-quality human dance images and videos with diverse appearances and flexible motions.

GaussianShader: 3D Gaussian Splatting with Shading Functions for Reflective Surfaces,"Jiang, Yingwenqi, Tu, Jiadong, Liu, Yuan, Gao, Xifeng, Long, Xiaoxiao, Wang, Wenping, Ma, Yuexin",The advent of neural 3D Gaussians has recently brought about a revolution in the field of neural rendering facilitating the generation of high-quality renderings at real-time speeds. However the explicit and discrete representation encounters challenges when applied to scenes featuring reflective surfaces. In this paper we present GaussianShader a novel method that applies a simplified shading function on 3D Gaussians to enhance the neural rendering in scenes with reflective surfaces while preserving the training and rendering efficiency. The main challenge in applying the shading function lies in the accurate normal estimation on discrete 3D Gaussians. Specifically we proposed a novel normal estimation framework based on the shortest axis directions of 3D Gaussians with a delicately designed loss to make the consistency between the normals and the geometries of Gaussian spheres. Experiments show that GaussianShader strikes a commendable balance between efficiency and visual quality. Our method surpasses Gaussian Splatting in PSNR on specular object datasets exhibiting an improvement of 1.57dB. When compared to prior works handling reflective surfaces such as Ref-NeRF our optimization time is significantly accelerated (23h vs. 0.58h).,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jiang_GaussianShader_3D_Gaussian_Splatting_with_Shading_Functions_for_Reflective_Surfaces_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
pix2gestalt: Amodal Segmentation by Synthesizing Wholes,"Ozguroglu, Ege, Liu, Ruoshi, Sur√≠s, D√≠dac, Chen, Dian, Dave, Achal, Tokmakov, Pavel, Vondrick, Carl",We introduce pix2gestalt a framework for zero-shot amodal segmentation which learns to estimate the shape and appearance of whole objects that are only partially visible behind occlusions. By capitalizing on large-scale diffusion models and transferring their representations to this task we learn a conditional diffusion model for reconstructing whole objects in challenging zero-shot cases including examples that break natural and physical priors such as art. As training data we use a synthetically curated dataset containing occluded objects paired with their whole counterparts. Experiments show that our approach outperforms supervised baselines on established benchmarks. Our model can furthermore be used to significantly improve the performance of existing object recognition and 3D reconstruction methods in the presence of occlusions.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ozguroglu_pix2gestalt_Amodal_Segmentation_by_Synthesizing_Wholes_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Weakly Supervised Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation via Artificial Oracle,"Kweon, Hyeokjun, Kim, Jihun, Yoon, Kuk-Jin",Manual annotation of every point in a point cloud is a costly and labor-intensive process. While weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation (WSPCSS) with sparse annotation shows promise the limited information from initial sparse labels can place an upper bound on performance. As a new research direction for WSPCSS we propose a novel Region Exploration via Artificial Labeling (REAL) framework. It leverages a foundational image model as an artificial oracle within the active learning context eliminating the need for manual annotation by a human oracle. To integrate the 2D model into the 3D domain we first introduce a Projection-based Point-toSegment (PP2S) module designed to enable prompt segmentation of 3D data without additional training. The REAL framework samples query points based on model predictions and requests annotations from PP2S dynamically refining labels and improving model training. Furthermore to overcome several challenges of employing an artificial model as an oracle we formulate effective query sampling and label updating strategies. Our comprehensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that the REAL framework significantly outperforms existing methods across various benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/jihun1998/AO.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kweon_Weakly_Supervised_Point_Cloud_Semantic_Segmentation_via_Artificial_Oracle_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Forecasting of 3D Whole-body Human Poses with Grasping Objects,"Yan, Haitao, Cui, Qiongjie, Xie, Jiexin, Guo, Shijie",In the context of computer vision and human-robot interaction forecasting 3D human poses is crucial for understanding human behavior and enhancing the predictive capabilities of intelligent systems. While existing methods have made significant progress they often focus on predicting major body joints overlooking fine-grained gestures and their interaction with objects. Human hand movements particularly during object interactions play a pivotal role and provide more precise expressions of human poses. This work fills this gap and introduces a novel paradigm: forecasting 3D whole-body human poses with a focus on grasping objects. This task involves predicting activities across all joints in the body and hands encompassing the complexities of internal heterogeneity and external interactivity. To tackle these challenges we also propose a novel approach: C^3HOST cross-context cross-modal consolidation for 3D whole-body pose forecasting effectively handles the complexities of internal heterogeneity and external interactivity. C^3HOST involves distinct steps including the heterogeneous content encoding and alignment and cross-modal feature learning and interaction. These enable us to predict activities across all body and hand joints ensuring high-precision whole-body human pose prediction even during object grasping. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that our model significantly enhances the accuracy of whole-body human motion prediction.

Accelerating Diffusion Sampling with Optimized Time Steps,"Xue, Shuchen, Liu, Zhaoqiang, Chen, Fei, Zhang, Shifeng, Hu, Tianyang, Xie, Enze, Li, Zhenguo",Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown remarkable performance in high-resolution image synthesis but their sampling efficiency is still to be desired due to the typically large number of sampling steps. Recent advancements in high-order numerical ODE solvers for DPMs have enabled the generation of high-quality images with much fewer sampling steps. While this is a significant development most sampling methods still employ uniform time steps which is not optimal when using a small number of steps. To address this issue we propose a general framework for designing an optimization problem that seeks more appropriate time steps for a specific numerical ODE solver for DPMs. This optimization problem aims to minimize the distance between the ground-truth solution to the ODE and an approximate solution corresponding to the numerical solver. It can be efficiently solved using the constrained trust region method taking less than 15 seconds. Our extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional sampling using pixel- and latent-space DPMs demonstrate that when combined with the state-of-the-art sampling method UniPC our optimized time steps significantly improve image generation performance in terms of FID scores for datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet compared to using uniform time steps.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xue_Accelerating_Diffusion_Sampling_with_Optimized_Time_Steps_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Unsupervised Template-assisted Point Cloud Shape Correspondence Network,"Deng, Jiacheng, Lu, Jiahao, Zhang, Tianzhu",Unsupervised point cloud shape correspondence aims to establish point-wise correspondences between source and target point clouds. Existing methods obtain correspondences directly by computing point-wise feature similarity between point clouds. However non-rigid objects possess strong deformability and unusual shapes making it a longstanding challenge to directly establish correspondences between point clouds with unconventional shapes. To address this challenge we propose an unsupervised Template-Assisted point cloud shape correspondence Network termed TANet including a template generation module and a template assistance module. The proposed TANet enjoys several merits. Firstly the template generation module establishes a set of learnable templates with explicit structures. Secondly we introduce a template assistance module that extensively leverages the generated templates to establish more accurate shape correspondences from multiple perspectives. Extensive experiments on four human and animal datasets demonstrate that TANet achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Deng_Unsupervised_Template-assisted_Point_Cloud_Shape_Correspondence_Network_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Finsler-Laplace-Beltrami Operators with Application to Shape Analysis,"Weber, Simon, Dag√®s, Thomas, Gao, Maolin, Cremers, Daniel",The Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO) emerges from studying manifolds equipped with a Riemannian metric. It is often called the swiss army knife of geometry processing as it allows to capture intrinsic shape information and gives rise to heat diffusion geodesic distances and a multitude of shape descriptors. It also plays a central role in geometric deep learning. In this work we explore Finsler manifolds as a generalization of Riemannian manifolds. We revisit the Finsler heat equation and derive a Finsler heat kernel and a Finsler-Laplace-Beltrami Operator (FLBO): a novel theoretically justified anisotropic Laplace-Beltrami operator (ALBO). In experimental evaluations we demonstrate that the proposed FLBO is a valuable alternative to the traditional Riemannian-based LBO and ALBOs for spatial filtering and shape correspondence estimation. We hope that the proposed Finsler heat kernel and the FLBO will inspire further exploration of Finsler geometry in the computer vision community.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Weber_Finsler-Laplace-Beltrami_Operators_with_Application_to_Shape_Analysis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Minimal Perspective Autocalibration,"Cin, Andrea Porfiri Dal, Duff, Timothy, Magri, Luca, Pajdla, Tomas",We introduce a new family of minimal problems for reconstruction from multiple views. Our primary focus is a novel approach to autocalibration a long-standing problem in computer vision. Traditional approaches to this problem such as those based on Kruppa's equations or the modulus constraint rely explicitly on the knowledge of multiple fundamental matrices or a projective reconstruction. In contrast we consider a novel formulation involving constraints on image points the unknown depths of 3D points and a partially specified calibration matrix K. For 2 and 3 views we present a comprehensive taxonomy of minimal autocalibration problems obtained by relaxing some of these constraints. These problems are organized into classes according to the number of views and any assumed prior knowledge of K. Within each class we determine problems with the fewest---or a relatively small number of---solutions. From this zoo of problems we devise three practical solvers. Experiments with synthetic and real data and interfacing our solvers with COLMAP demonstrate that we achieve superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art calibration methods. The code is available at https://github.com/andreadalcin/MinimalPerspectiveAutocalibration.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Dal_Cin_Minimal_Perspective_Autocalibration_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Time- Memory- and Parameter-Efficient Visual Adaptation,"Mercea, Otniel-Bogdan, Gritsenko, Alexey, Schmid, Cordelia, Arnab, Anurag",As foundation models become more popular there is a growing need to efficiently finetune them for downstream tasks. Although numerous adaptation methods have been proposed they are designed to be efficient only in terms of how many parameters are trained. They however typically still require backpropagating gradients throughout the model meaning that their training-time and -memory cost does not reduce as significantly. We propose an adaptation method which does not backpropagate gradients through the backbone. We achieve this by designing a lightweight network in parallel that operates on features from the frozen pretrained backbone. As a result our method is efficient not only in terms of parameters but also in training-time and memory usage. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-parameter trade-offs on the popular VTAB benchmark and we further show how we outperform prior works with respect to training-time and -memory usage too. We further demonstrate the training efficiency and scalability of our method by adapting a vision transformer backbone of 4 billion parameters for the computationally demanding task of video classification without any intricate model parallelism. Here we outperform a prior adaptor-based method which could only scale to a 1 billion parameter backbone or fully-finetuning a smaller backbone with the same GPU and less training time.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mercea_Time-_Memory-_and_Parameter-Efficient_Visual_Adaptation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Suppress and Rebalance: Towards Generalized Multi-Modal Face Anti-Spoofing,"Lin, Xun, Wang, Shuai, Cai, Rizhao, Liu, Yizhong, Fu, Ying, Tang, Wenzhong, Yu, Zitong, Kot, Alex",Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is crucial for securing face recognition systems against presentation attacks. With advancements in sensor manufacture and multi-modal learning techniques many multi-modal FAS approaches have emerged. However they face challenges in generalizing to unseen attacks and deployment conditions. These challenges arise from (1) modality unreliability where some modality sensors like depth and infrared undergo significant domain shifts in varying environments leading to the spread of unreliable information during cross-modal feature fusion and (2) modality imbalance where training overly relies on a dominant modality hinders the convergence of others reducing effectiveness against attack types that are indistinguishable by sorely using the dominant modality. To address modality unreliability we propose the Uncertainty-Guided Cross-Adapter (U-Adapter) to recognize unreliably detected regions within each modality and suppress the impact of unreliable regions on other modalities. For modality imbalance we propose a Rebalanced Modality Gradient Modulation (ReGrad) strategy to rebalance the convergence speed of all modalities by adaptively adjusting their gradients. Besides we provide the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-modal FAS performance under domain generalization scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Source codes and protocols are released on https://github.com/OMGGGGG/mmdg.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lin_Suppress_and_Rebalance_Towards_Generalized_Multi-Modal_Face_Anti-Spoofing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Universal Segmentation at Arbitrary Granularity with Language Instruction,"Liu, Yong, Zhang, Cairong, Wang, Yitong, Wang, Jiahao, Yang, Yujiu, Tang, Yansong",This paper aims to achieve universal segmentation of arbitrary semantic level. Despite significant progress in recent years specialist segmentation approaches are limited to specific tasks and data distribution. Retraining a new model for adaptation to new scenarios or settings takes expensive computation and time cost which raises the demand for versatile and universal segmentation model that can cater to various granularity. Although some attempts have been made for unifying different segmentation tasks or generalization to various scenarios limitations in the definition of paradigms and input-output spaces make it difficult for them to achieve accurate understanding of content at arbitrary granularity. To this end we present UniLSeg a universal segmentation model that can perform segmentation at any semantic level with the guidance of language instructions. For training UniLSeg we reorganize a group of tasks from original diverse distributions into a unified data format where images with texts describing segmentation targets as input and corresponding masks are output. Combined with a automatic annotation engine for utilizing numerous unlabeled data UniLSeg achieves excellent performance on various tasks and settings surpassing both specialist and unified segmentation models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Universal_Segmentation_at_Arbitrary_Granularity_with_Language_Instruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Layout-Agnostic Scene Text Image Synthesis with Diffusion Models,"Zhangli, Qilong, Jiang, Jindong, Liu, Di, Yu, Licheng, Dai, Xiaoliang, Ramchandani, Ankit, Pang, Guan, Metaxas, Dimitris N., Krishnan, Praveen",While diffusion models have significantly advanced the quality of image generation their capability to accurately and coherently render text within these images remains a substantial challenge. Conventional diffusion-based methods for scene text generation are typically limited by their reliance on an intermediate layout output. This dependency often results in a constrained diversity of text styles and fonts an inherent limitation stemming from the deterministic nature of the layout generation phase. To address these challenges this paper introduces SceneTextGen a novel diffusion-based model specifically designed to circumvent the need for a predefined layout stage. By doing so SceneTextGen facilitates a more natural and varied representation of text. The novelty of SceneTextGen lies in its integration of three key components: a character-level encoder for capturing detailed typographic properties coupled with a character-level instance segmentation model and a word-level spotting model to address the issues of unwanted text generation and minor character inaccuracies. We validate the performance of our method by demonstrating improved character recognition rates on generated images across different public visual text datasets in comparison to both standard diffusion based methods and text specific methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhangli_Layout-Agnostic_Scene_Text_Image_Synthesis_with_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SmartMask: Context Aware High-Fidelity Mask Generation for Fine-grained Object Insertion and Layout Control,"Singh, Jaskirat, Zhang, Jianming, Liu, Qing, Smith, Cameron, Lin, Zhe, Zheng, Liang",The field of generative image inpainting and object insertion has made significant progress with the recent advent of latent diffusion models. Utilizing a precise object mask can greatly enhance these applications. However due to the challenges users encounter in creating high-fidelity masks there is a tendency for these methods to rely on more coarse masks (e.g. bounding box) for these applications. This results in limited control and compromised background content preservation. To overcome these limitations we introduce SmartMask which allows any novice user to create detailed masks for precise object insertion. Combined with a ControlNet-Inpaint model our experiments demonstrate that SmartMask achieves superior object insertion quality preserving the background content more effectively than previous methods. Notably unlike prior works the proposed approach can also be used even without user-mask guidance which allows it to perform mask-free object insertion at diverse positions and scales. Furthermore we find that when used iteratively with a novel instruction-tuning based planning model SmartMask can be used to design detailed layouts from scratch. As compared with user-scribble based layout design we observe that SmartMask allows for better quality outputs with layout-to-image generation methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Singh_SmartMask_Context_Aware_High-Fidelity_Mask_Generation_for_Fine-grained_Object_Insertion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Customization Assistant for Text-to-Image Generation,"Zhou, Yufan, Zhang, Ruiyi, Gu, Jiuxiang, Sun, Tong",Customizing pre-trained text-to-image generation model has attracted massive research interest recently due to its huge potential in real-world applications. Although existing methods are able to generate creative content for a novel concept contained in single user-input image their capability are still far from perfection. Specifically most existing methods require fine-tuning the generative model on testing images. Some existing methods do not require fine-tuning while their performance are unsatisfactory. Furthermore the interaction between users and models are still limited to directive and descriptive prompts such as instructions and captions. In this work we build a customization assistant based on pre-trained large language model and diffusion model which can not only perform customized generation in a tuning-free manner but also enable more user-friendly interactions: users can chat with the assistant and input either ambiguous text or clear instruction. Specifically we propose a new framework consists of a new model design and a novel training strategy. The resulting assistant can perform customized generation in 2-5 seconds without any test time fine-tuning. Extensive experiments are conducted competitive results have been obtained across different domains illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_Customization_Assistant_for_Text-to-Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Paint-it: Text-to-Texture Synthesis via Deep Convolutional Texture Map Optimization and Physically-Based Rendering,"Youwang, Kim, Oh, Tae-Hyun, Pons-Moll, Gerard",We present Paint-it a text-driven high-fidelity texture map synthesis method for 3D meshes via neural re-parameterized texture optimization. Paint-it synthesizes texture maps from a text description by synthesis-through-optimization exploiting the Score-Distillation Sampling (SDS). We observe that directly applying SDS yields undesirable texture quality due to its noisy gradients. We reveal the importance of texture parameterization when using SDS. Specifically we propose Deep Convolutional Physically-Based Rendering (DC-PBR) parameterization which re-parameterizes the physically-based rendering (PBR) texture maps with randomly initialized convolution-based neural kernels instead of a standard pixel-based parameterization. We show that DC-PBR inherently schedules the optimization curriculum according to texture frequency and naturally filters out the noisy signals from SDS. In experiments Paint-it obtains remarkable quality PBR texture maps within 15 min. given only a text description. We demonstrate the generalizability and practicality of Paint-it by synthesizing high-quality texture maps for large-scale mesh datasets and showing test-time applications such as relighting and material control using a popular graphics engine.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Youwang_Paint-it_Text-to-Texture_Synthesis_via_Deep_Convolutional_Texture_Map_Optimization_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Physics-Aware Hand-Object Interaction Denoising,"Luo, Haowen, Liu, Yunze, Yi, Li",The credibility and practicality of a reconstructed hand-object interaction sequence depend largely on its physical plausibility. However due to high occlusions during hand-object interaction physical plausibility remains a challenging criterion for purely vision-based tracking methods. To address this issue and enhance the results of existing hand trackers this paper proposes a novel physically-aware hand motion de-noising method. Specifically we introduce two learned loss terms that explicitly capture two crucial aspects of physical plausibility: grasp credibility and manipulation feasibility. These terms are used to train a physically-aware de-noising network. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both fine-grained physical plausibility and overall pose accuracy surpassing current state-of-the-art de-noising methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Luo_Physics-Aware_Hand-Object_Interaction_Denoising_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
VastGaussian: Vast 3D Gaussians for Large Scene Reconstruction,"Lin, Jiaqi, Li, Zhihao, Tang, Xiao, Liu, Jianzhuang, Liu, Shiyong, Liu, Jiayue, Lu, Yangdi, Wu, Xiaofei, Xu, Songcen, Yan, Youliang, Yang, Wenming",Existing NeRF-based methods for large scene reconstruction often have limitations in visual quality and rendering speed. While the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting works well on small-scale and object-centric scenes scaling it up to large scenes poses challenges due to limited video memory long optimization time and noticeable appearance variations. To address these challenges we present VastGaussian the first method for high-quality reconstruction and real-time rendering on large scenes based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. We propose a progressive partitioning strategy to divide a large scene into multiple cells where the training cameras and point cloud are properly distributed with an airspace-aware visibility criterion. These cells are merged into a complete scene after parallel optimization. We also introduce decoupled appearance modeling into the optimization process to reduce appearance variations in the rendered images. Our approach outperforms existing NeRF-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple large scene datasets enabling fast optimization and high-fidelity real-time rendering.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lin_VastGaussian_Vast_3D_Gaussians_for_Large_Scene_Reconstruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Edit One for All: Interactive Batch Image Editing,"Nguyen, Thao, Ojha, Utkarsh, Li, Yuheng, Liu, Haotian, Lee, Yong Jae",In recent years image editing has advanced remarkably. With increased human control it is now possible to edit an image in a plethora of ways; from specifying in text what we want to change to straight up dragging the contents of the image in an interactive point-based manner. However most of the focus has remained on editing single images at a time. Whether and how we can simultaneously edit large batches of images has remained understudied. With the goal of minimizing human supervision in the editing process this paper presents a novel method for interactive batch image editing using StyleGAN as the medium. Given an edit specified by users in an example image (e.g. make the face frontal) our method can automatically transfer that edit to other test images so that regardless of their initial state (pose) they all arrive at the same final state (e.g. all facing front). Extensive experiments demonstrate that edits performed using our method have similar visual quality to existing single-image-editing methods while having more visual consistency and saving significant time and human effort.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Nguyen_Edit_One_for_All_Interactive_Batch_Image_Editing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Deformable One-shot Face Stylization via DINO Semantic Guidance,"Zhou, Yang, Chen, Zichong, Huang, Hui",This paper addresses the complex issue of one-shot face stylization focusing on the simultaneous consideration of appearance and structure where previous methods have fallen short. We explore deformation-aware face stylization that diverges from traditional single-image style reference opting for a real-style image pair instead. The cornerstone of our method is the utilization of a self-supervised vision transformer specifically DINO-ViT to establish a robust and consistent facial structure representation across both real and style domains. Our stylization process begins by adapting the StyleGAN generator to be deformation-aware through the integration of spatial transformers (STN). We then introduce two innovative constraints for generator fine-tuning under the guidance of DINO semantics: i) a directional deformation loss that regulates directional vectors in DINO space and ii) a relative structural consistency constraint based on DINO token self-similarities ensuring diverse generation. Additionally style-mixing is employed to align the color generation with the reference minimizing inconsistent correspondences. This framework delivers enhanced deformability for general one-shot face stylization achieving notable efficiency with a fine-tuning duration of approximately 10 minutes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art one-shot face stylization methods.

Coarse-to-Fine Latent Diffusion for Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis,"Lu, Yanzuo, Zhang, Manlin, Ma, Andy J, Xie, Xiaohua, Lai, Jianhuang",Diffusion model is a promising approach to image generation and has been employed for Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) with competitive performance. While existing methods simply align the person appearance to the target pose they are prone to overfitting due to the lack of a high-level semantic understanding on the source person image. In this paper we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Latent Diffusion (CFLD) method for PGPIS. In the absence of image-caption pairs and textual prompts we develop a novel training paradigm purely based on images to control the generation process of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. A perception-refined decoder is designed to progressively refine a set of learnable queries and extract semantic understanding of person images as a coarse-grained prompt. This allows for the decoupling of fine-grained appearance and pose information controls at different stages and thus circumventing the potential overfitting problem. To generate more realistic texture details a hybrid-granularity attention module is proposed to encode multi-scale fine-grained appearance features as bias terms to augment the coarse-grained prompt. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the DeepFashion benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state of the arts for PGPIS. Code is available at https://github.com/YanzuoLu/CFLD.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lu_Coarse-to-Fine_Latent_Diffusion_for_Pose-Guided_Person_Image_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
OMG: Towards Open-vocabulary Motion Generation via Mixture of Controllers,"Liang, Han, Bao, Jiacheng, Zhang, Ruichi, Ren, Sihan, Xu, Yuecheng, Yang, Sibei, Chen, Xin, Yu, Jingyi, Xu, Lan",We have recently seen tremendous progress in realistic text-to-motion generation. Yet the existing methods often fail or produce implausible motions with unseen text inputs which limits the applications. In this paper we present OMG a novel framework which enables compelling motion generation from zero-shot open-vocabulary text prompts. Our key idea is to carefully tailor the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm into the text-to-motion generation. At the pre-training stage our model improves the generation ability by learning the rich out-of-domain inherent motion traits. To this end we scale up a large unconditional diffusion model up to 1B parameters so as to utilize the massive unlabeled motion data up to over 20M motion instances. At the subsequent fine-tuning stage we introduce motion ControlNet which incorporates text prompts as conditioning information through a trainable copy of the pre-trained model and the proposed novel Mixture-of-Controllers (MoC) block. MoC block adaptively recognizes various ranges of the sub-motions with a cross-attention mechanism and processes them separately with the text-token-specific experts. Such a design effectively aligns the CLIP token embeddings of text prompts to various ranges of compact and expressive motion features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OMG achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot text-to-motion generation.

Align Your Gaussians: Text-to-4D with Dynamic 3D Gaussians and Composed Diffusion Models,"Ling, Huan, Kim, Seung Wook, Torralba, Antonio, Fidler, Sanja, Kreis, Karsten",Text-guided diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation and have also been successfully used for optimization-based 3D object synthesis. Here we instead focus on the underexplored text-to-4D setting and synthesize dynamic animated 3D objects using score distillation methods with an additional temporal dimension. Compared to previous work we pursue a novel compositional generation-based approach and combine text-to-image text-to-video and 3D-aware multiview diffusion models to provide feedback during 4D object optimization thereby simultaneously enforcing temporal consistency high-quality visual appearance and realistic geometry. Our method called Align Your Gaussians (AYG) leverages dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting with deformation fields as 4D representation. Crucial to AYG is a novel method to regularize the distribution of the moving 3D Gaussians and thereby stabilize the optimization and induce motion. We also propose a motion amplification mechanism as well as a new autoregressive synthesis scheme to generate and combine multiple 4D sequences for longer generation. These techniques allow us to synthesize vivid dynamic scenes outperform previous work qualitatively and quantitatively and achieve state-of-the-art text-to-4D performance. Due to the Gaussian 4D representation different 4D animations can be seamlessly combined as we demonstrate. AYG opens up promising avenues for animation simulation and digital content creation as well as synthetic data generation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ling_Align_Your_Gaussians_Text-to-4D_with_Dynamic_3D_Gaussians_and_Composed_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PDF: A Probability-Driven Framework for Open World 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Xu, Jinfeng, Yang, Siyuan, Li, Xianzhi, Tang, Yuan, Hao, Yixue, Hu, Long, Chen, Min",Existing point cloud semantic segmentation networks cannot identify unknown classes and update their knowledge due to a closed-set and static perspective of the real world which would induce the intelligent agent to make bad decisions. To address this problem we propose a Probability-Driven Framework (PDF) for open world semantic segmentation that includes (i) a lightweight U-decoder branch to identify unknown classes by estimating the uncertainties (ii) a flexible pseudo-labeling scheme to supply geometry features along with probability distribution features of unknown classes by generating pseudo labels and (iii) an incremental knowledge distillation strategy to incorporate novel classes into the existing knowledge base gradually. Our framework enables the model to behave like human beings which could recognize unknown objects and incrementally learn them with the corresponding knowledge. Experimental results on the S3DIS and ScanNetv2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed PDF outperforms other methods by a large margin in both important tasks of open world semantic segmentation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_PDF_A_Probability-Driven_Framework_for_Open_World_3D_Point_Cloud_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Test-Time Domain Generalization for Face Anti-Spoofing,"Zhou, Qianyu, Zhang, Ke-Yue, Yao, Taiping, Lu, Xuequan, Ding, Shouhong, Ma, Lizhuang",Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is pivotal in safeguarding facial recognition systems against presentation attacks. While domain generalization (DG) methods have been developed to enhance FAS performance they predominantly focus on learning domain-invariant features during training which may not guarantee generalizability to unseen data that differs largely from the source distributions. Our insight is that testing data can serve as a valuable resource to enhance the generalizability beyond mere evaluation for DG FAS. In this paper we introduce a novel Test-Time Domain Generalization (TTDG) framework for FAS which leverages the testing data to boost the model's generalizability. Our method consisting of Test-Time Style Projection (TTSP) and Diverse Style Shifts Simulation (DSSS) effectively projects the unseen data to the seen domain space. In particular we first introduce the innovative TTSP to project the styles of the arbitrarily unseen samples of the testing distribution to the known source space of the training distributions. We then design the efficient DSSS to synthesize diverse style shifts via learnable style bases with two specifically designed losses in a hyperspherical feature space. Our method eliminates the need for model updates at the test time and can be seamlessly integrated into not only the CNN but also ViT backbones. Comprehensive experiments on widely used cross-domain FAS benchmarks demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_Test-Time_Domain_Generalization_for_Face_Anti-Spoofing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Real-time 3D-aware Portrait Video Relighting,"Cai, Ziqi, Jiang, Kaiwen, Chen, Shu-Yu, Lai, Yu-Kun, Fu, Hongbo, Shi, Boxin, Gao, Lin",Synthesizing realistic videos of talking faces under custom lighting conditions and viewing angles benefits various downstream applications like video conferencing. However most existing relighting methods are either time-consuming or unable to adjust the viewpoints. In this paper we present the first real-time 3D-aware method for relighting in-the-wild videos of talking faces based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Given an input portrait video our method can synthesize talking faces under both novel views and novel lighting conditions with a photo-realistic and disentangled 3D representation. Specifically we infer an albedo tri-plane as well as a shading tri-plane based on a desired lighting condition for each video frame with fast dual-encoders. We also leverage a temporal consistency network to ensure smooth transitions and reduce flickering artifacts. Our method runs at 32.98 fps on consumer-level hardware and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of reconstruction quality lighting error lighting instability temporal consistency and inference speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interactivity of our method on various portrait videos with diverse lighting and viewing conditions.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cai_Real-time_3D-aware_Portrait_Video_Relighting_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
3DGS-Avatar: Animatable Avatars via Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting,"Qian, Zhiyin, Wang, Shaofei, Mihajlovic, Marko, Geiger, Andreas, Tang, Siyu",We introduce an approach that creates animatable human avatars from monocular videos using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Existing methods based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) achieve high-quality novel-view/novel-pose image synthesis but often require days of training and are extremely slow at inference time. Recently the community has explored fast grid structures for efficient training of clothed avatars. Albeit being extremely fast at training these methods can barely achieve an interactive rendering frame rate with around 15 FPS. In this paper we use 3D Gaussian Splatting and learn a non-rigid deformation network to reconstruct animatable clothed human avatars that can be trained within 30 minutes and rendered at real-time frame rates (50+ FPS). Given the explicit nature of our representation we further introduce as-isometric-as-possible regularizations on both the Gaussian mean vectors and the covariance matrices enhancing the generalization of our model on highly articulated unseen poses. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable and even better performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches on animatable avatar creation from a monocular input while being 400x and 250x faster in training and inference respectively.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Qian_3DGS-Avatar_Animatable_Avatars_via_Deformable_3D_Gaussian_Splatting_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Style Aligned Image Generation via Shared Attention,"Hertz, Amir, Voynov, Andrey, Fruchter, Shlomi, Cohen-Or, Daniel",Large-scale Text-to-Image (T2I) models have rapidly gained prominence across creative fields generating visually compelling outputs from textual prompts. However controlling these models to ensure consistent style remains challenging with existing methods necessitating fine-tuning and manual intervention to disentangle content and style. In this paper we introduce StyleAligned a novel technique designed to establish style alignment among a series of generated images. By employing minimal `attention sharing' during the diffusion process our method maintains style consistency across images within T2I models. This approach allows for the creation of style-consistent images using a reference style through a straightforward inversion operation. Our method's evaluation across diverse styles and text prompts demonstrates high-quality synthesis and fidelity underscoring its efficacy in achieving consistent style across various inputs.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hertz_Style_Aligned_Image_Generation_via_Shared_Attention_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Back to 3D: Few-Shot 3D Keypoint Detection with Back-Projected 2D Features,"Wimmer, Thomas, Wonka, Peter, Ovsjanikov, Maks",With the immense growth of dataset sizes and computing resources in recent years so-called foundation models have become popular in NLP and vision tasks. In this work we propose to explore foundation models for the task of keypoint detection on 3D shapes. A unique characteristic of keypoint detection is that it requires semantic and geometric awareness while demanding high localization accuracy. To address this problem we propose first to back-project features from large pre-trained 2D vision models onto 3D shapes and employ them for this task. We show that we obtain robust 3D features that contain rich semantic information and analyze multiple candidate features stemming from different 2D foundation models. Second we employ a keypoint candidate optimization module which aims to match the average observed distribution of keypoints on the shape and is guided by the back-projected features. The resulting approach achieves a new state of the art for few-shot keypoint detection on the KeyPointNet dataset almost doubling the performance of the previous best methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wimmer_Back_to_3D_Few-Shot_3D_Keypoint_Detection_with_Back-Projected_2D_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Neural Markov Random Field for Stereo Matching,"Guan, Tongfan, Wang, Chen, Liu, Yun-Hui",Stereo matching is a core task for many computer vision and robotics applications. Despite their dominance in traditional stereo methods the hand-crafted Markov Random Field (MRF) models lack sufficient modeling accuracy compared to end-to-end deep models. While deep learning representations have greatly improved the unary terms of the MRF models the overall accuracy is still severely limited by the hand-crafted pairwise terms and message passing. To address these issues we propose a neural MRF model where both potential functions and message passing are designed using data-driven neural networks. Our fully data-driven model is built on the foundation of variational inference theory to prevent convergence issues and retain stereo MRF's graph inductive bias. To make the inference tractable and scale well to high-resolution images we also propose a Disparity Proposal Network (DPN) to adaptively prune the search space of disparity. The proposed approach ranks 1^ st  on both KITTI 2012 and 2015 leaderboards among all published methods while running faster than 100 ms. This approach significantly outperforms prior global methods e.g. lowering D1 metric by more than 50% on KITTI 2015. In addition our method exhibits strong cross-domain generalization and can recover sharp edges.

PoseIRM: Enhance 3D Human Pose Estimation on Unseen Camera Settings via Invariant Risk Minimization,"Cai, Yanlu, Zhang, Weizhong, Wu, Yuan, Jin, Cheng",Camera-parameter-free multi-view pose estimation is an emerging technique for 3D human pose estimation (HPE). They can infer the camera settings implicitly or explicitly to mitigate the depth uncertainty impact showcasing significant potential in real applications. However due to the limited camera setting diversity in the available datasets the inferred camera parameters are always simply hardcoded into the model during training and not adaptable to the input in inference making the learned models cannot generalize well under unseen camera settings. A natural solution is to artificially synthesize some samples i.e. 2D-3D pose pairs under massive new camera settings. Unfortunately to prevent over-fitting the existing camera setting the number of synthesized samples for each new camera setting should be comparable with that for the existing one which multiplies the scale of training and even makes it computationally prohibitive. In this paper we propose a novel HPE approach under the invariant risk minimization (IRM) paradigm. Precisely we first synthesize 2D poses from myriad camera settings. We then train our model under the IRM paradigm which targets at learning a common optimal model across all camera settings and thus enforces the model to automatically learn the camera parameters based on the input data. This allows the model to accurately infer 3D poses on unseen data by training on only a handful of samples from each synthesized setting and thus avoid the unbearable training cost increment. Another appealing feature of our method is that benefited from the capability of IRM in identifying the invariant features its performance on the seen camera settings is enhanced as well. Comprehensive experiments verify the superiority of our approach.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cai_PoseIRM_Enhance_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_on_Unseen_Camera_Settings_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CCEdit: Creative and Controllable Video Editing via Diffusion Models,"Feng, Ruoyu, Weng, Wenming, Wang, Yanhui, Yuan, Yuhui, Bao, Jianmin, Luo, Chong, Chen, Zhibo, Guo, Baining",In this paper we present CCEdit a versatile generative video editing framework based on diffusion models. Our approach employs a novel trident network structure that separates structure and appearance control ensuring precise and creative editing capabilities. Utilizing the foundational ControlNet architecture we maintain the structural integrity of the video during editing. The incorporation of an additional appearance branch enables users to exert fine-grained control over the edited key frame. These two side branches seamlessly integrate into the main branch which is constructed upon existing text-to-image (T2I) generation models through learnable temporal layers. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated through a diverse range of choices in both structure representations and personalized T2I models as well as the option to provide the edited key frame. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation we introduce the BalanceCC benchmark dataset comprising 100 videos and 4 target prompts for each video. Our extensive user studies compare CCEdit with eight state-of-the-art video editing methods. The outcomes demonstrate CCEdit's substantial superiority over all other methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Feng_CCEdit_Creative_and_Controllable_Video_Editing_via_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HAVE-FUN: Human Avatar Reconstruction from Few-Shot Unconstrained Images,"Yang, Xihe, Chen, Xingyu, Gao, Daiheng, Wang, Shaohui, Han, Xiaoguang, Wang, Baoyuan",As for human avatar reconstruction contemporary techniques commonly necessitate the acquisition of costly data and struggle to achieve satisfactory results from a small number of casual images. In this paper we investigate this task from a few-shot unconstrained photo album. The reconstruction of human avatars from such data sources is challenging because of limited data amount and dynamic articulated poses. For handling dynamic data we integrate a skinning mechanism with deep marching tetrahedra (DMTet) to form a drivable tetrahedral representation which drives arbitrary mesh topologies generated by the DMTet for the adaptation of unconstrained images. To effectively mine instructive information from few-shot data we devise a two-phase optimization method with few-shot reference and few-shot guidance. The former focuses on aligning avatar identity with reference images while the latter aims to generate plausible appearances for unseen regions. Overall our framework called HaveFun can undertake avatar reconstruction rendering and animation. Extensive experiments on our developed benchmarks demonstrate that HaveFun exhibits substantially superior performance in reconstructing the human body and hand.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yang_HAVE-FUN_Human_Avatar_Reconstruction_from_Few-Shot_Unconstrained_Images_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DiffMorpher: Unleashing the Capability of Diffusion Models for Image Morphing,"Zhang, Kaiwen, Zhou, Yifan, Xu, Xudong, Dai, Bo, Pan, Xingang",Diffusion models have achieved remarkable image generation quality surpassing previous generative models. However a notable limitation of diffusion models in comparison to GANs is their difficulty in smoothly interpolating between two image samples due to their highly unstructured latent space. Such a smooth interpolation is intriguing as it naturally serves as a solution for the image morphing task with many applications. In this work we address this limitation via DiffMorpher an approach that enables smooth and natural image interpolation by harnessing the prior knowledge of a pre-trained diffusion model. Our key idea is to capture the semantics of the two images by fitting two LoRAs to them respectively and interpolate between both the LoRA parameters and the latent noises to ensure a smooth semantic transition where correspondence automatically emerges without the need for annotation. In addition we propose an attention interpolation and injection technique an adaptive normalization adjustment method and a new sampling schedule to further enhance the smoothness between consecutive images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffMorpher achieves starkly better image morphing effects than previous methods across a variety of object categories bridging a critical functional gap that distinguished diffusion models from GANs.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_DiffMorpher_Unleashing_the_Capability_of_Diffusion_Models_for_Image_Morphing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Towards Real-World HDR Video Reconstruction: A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset and A Two-Stage Alignment Network,"Shu, Yong, Shen, Liquan, Hu, Xiangyu, Li, Mengyao, Zhou, Zihao",As an important and practical way to obtain high dynamic range (HDR) video HDR video reconstruction from sequences with alternating exposures is still less explored mainly due to the lack of large-scale real-world datasets. Existing methods are mostly trained on synthetic datasets which perform poorly in real scenes. In this work to facilitate the development of real-world HDR video reconstruction we present Real-HDRV a large-scale real-world benchmark dataset for HDR video reconstruction featuring various scenes diverse motion patterns and high-quality labels. Specifically our dataset contains 500 LDRs-HDRs video pairs comprising about 28000 LDR frames and 4000 HDR labels covering daytime nighttime indoor and outdoor scenes. To our best knowledge our dataset is the largest real-world HDR video reconstruction dataset. Correspondingly we propose an end-to-end network for HDR video reconstruction where a novel two-stage strategy is designed to perform alignment sequentially. Specifically the first stage performs global alignment with the adaptively estimated global offsets reducing the difficulty of subsequent alignment. The second stage implicitly performs local alignment in a coarse-to-fine manner at the feature level using the adaptive separable convolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) models trained on our dataset can achieve better performance on real scenes than those trained on synthetic datasets; (2) our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/yungsyu99/Real-HDRV.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shu_Towards_Real-World_HDR_Video_Reconstruction_A_Large-Scale_Benchmark_Dataset_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Efficient 3D Implicit Head Avatar with Mesh-anchored Hash Table Blendshapes,"Bai, Ziqian, Tan, Feitong, Fanello, Sean, Pandey, Rohit, Dou, Mingsong, Liu, Shichen, Tan, Ping, Zhang, Yinda",3D head avatars built with neural implicit volumetric representations have achieved unprecedented levels of photorealism. However the computational cost of these methods remains a significant barrier to their widespread adoption particularly in real-time applications such as virtual reality and teleconferencing. While attempts have been made to develop fast neural rendering approaches for static scenes these methods cannot be simply employed to support realistic facial expressions such as in the case of a dynamic facial performance. To address these challenges we propose a novel fast 3D neural implicit head avatar model that achieves real-time rendering while maintaining fine-grained controllability and high rendering quality. Our key idea lies in the introduction of local hash table blendshapes which are learned and attached to the vertices of an underlying face parametric model. These per-vertex hash-tables are linearly merged with weights predicted via a CNN resulting in expression dependent embeddings. Our novel representation enables efficient density and color predictions using a lightweight MLP which is further accelerated by a hierarchical nearest neighbor search method. Extensive experiments show that our approach runs in real-time while achieving comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-arts and decent results on challenging expressions.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bai_Efficient_3D_Implicit_Head_Avatar_with_Mesh-anchored_Hash_Table_Blendshapes_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
No Time to Train: Empowering Non-Parametric Networks for Few-shot 3D Scene Segmentation,"Zhu, Xiangyang, Zhang, Renrui, He, Bowei, Guo, Ziyu, Liu, Jiaming, Xiao, Han, Fu, Chaoyou, Dong, Hao, Gao, Peng",To reduce the reliance on large-scale datasets recent works in 3D segmentation resort to few-shot learning. Current 3D few-shot segmentation methods first pre-train models on 'seen' classes and then evaluate their generalization performance on 'unseen' classes. However the prior pre-training stage not only introduces excessive time overhead but also incurs a significant domain gap on 'unseen' classes. To tackle these issues we propose a Non-parametric Network for few-shot 3D Segmentation Seg-NN and its Parametric variant Seg-PN. Without training Seg-NN extracts dense representations by hand-crafted filters and achieves comparable performance to existing parameterized models. Due to the elimination of pre-training Seg-NN can alleviate the domain gap issue and save a substantial amount of time. Based on Seg-NN Seg-PN only requires training a lightweight QUEry-Support Transferring (QUEST) module which enhances the interaction between the support set and query set. Experiments suggest that Seg-PN outperforms previous state-of-the-art method by +4.19% and +7.71% mIoU on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets respectively while reducing training time by -90% indicating its effectiveness and efficiency.

PhysGaussian: Physics-Integrated 3D Gaussians for Generative Dynamics,"Xie, Tianyi, Zong, Zeshun, Qiu, Yuxing, Li, Xuan, Feng, Yutao, Yang, Yin, Jiang, Chenfanfu","We introduce PhysGaussian a new method that seamlessly integrates physically grounded Newtonian dynamics within 3D Gaussians to achieve high-quality novel motion synthesis. Employing a customized Material Point Method (MPM) our approach enriches 3D Gaussian kernels with physically meaningful kinematic deformation and mechanical stress attributes all evolved in line with continuum mechanics principles. A defining characteristic of our method is the seamless integration between physical simulation and visual rendering: both components utilize the same 3D Gaussian kernels as their discrete representations. This negates the necessity for triangle/tetrahedron meshing marching cubes cage meshes or any other geometry embedding highlighting the principle of ""what you see is what you simulate (WS^2)"". Our method demonstrates exceptional versatility across a wide variety of materials--including elastic entities plastic metals non-Newtonian fluids and granular materials--showcasing its strong capabilities in creating diverse visual content with novel viewpoints and movements.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xie_PhysGaussian_Physics-Integrated_3D_Gaussians_for_Generative_Dynamics_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Spatio-Temporal Turbulence Mitigation: A Translational Perspective,"Zhang, Xingguang, Chimitt, Nicholas, Chi, Yiheng, Mao, Zhiyuan, Chan, Stanley H.",Recovering images distorted by atmospheric turbulence is a challenging inverse problem due to the stochastic nature of turbulence. Although numerous turbulence mitigation (TM) algorithms have been proposed their efficiency and generalization to real-world dynamic scenarios remain severely limited. Building upon the intuitions of classical TM algorithms we present the Deep Atmospheric TUrbulence Mitigation network (DATUM). DATUM aims to overcome major challenges when transitioning from classical to deep learning approaches. By carefully integrating the merits of classical multi-frame TM methods into a deep network structure we demonstrate that DATUM can efficiently perform long-range temporal aggregation using a recurrent fashion while deformable attention and temporal-channel attention seamlessly facilitate pixel registration and lucky imaging. With additional supervision tilt and blur degradation can be jointly mitigated. These inductive biases empower DATUM to significantly outperform existing methods while delivering a tenfold increase in processing speed. A large-scale training dataset ATSyn is presented as a co-invention to enable the generalization to real turbulence. Our code and datasets are available at https://xg416.github.io/DATUM/,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Spatio-Temporal_Turbulence_Mitigation_A_Translational_Perspective_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Grounded Text-to-Image Synthesis with Attention Refocusing,"Phung, Quynh, Ge, Songwei, Huang, Jia-Bin",Driven by the scalable diffusion models trained on large-scale datasets text-to-image synthesis methods have shown compelling results. However these models still fail to precisely follow the text prompt involving multiple objects attributes or spatial compositions. In this paper we reveal the potential causes of the diffusion model's cross-attention and self-attention layers. We propose two novel losses to refocus attention maps according to a given spatial layout during sampling. Creating the layouts manually requires additional effort and can be tedious. Therefore we explore using large language models (LLM) to produce these layouts for our method. We conduct extensive experiments on the DrawBench HRS and TIFA benchmarks to evaluate our proposed method. We show that our proposed attention refocusing effectively improves the controllability of existing approaches.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Phung_Grounded_Text-to-Image_Synthesis_with_Attention_Refocusing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
IReNe: Instant Recoloring of Neural Radiance Fields,"Mazzucchelli, Alessio, Garcia-Garcia, Adrian, Garces, Elena, Rivas-Manzaneque, Fernando, Moreno-Noguer, Francesc, Penate-Sanchez, Adrian",Advances in NERFs have allowed for 3D scene reconstructions and novel view synthesis. Yet efficiently editing these representations while retaining photorealism is an emerging challenge. Recent methods face three primary limitations: they're slow for interactive use lack precision at object boundaries and struggle to ensure multi-view consistency. We introduce IReNe to address these limitations enabling swift near real-time color editing in NeRF. Leveraging a pre-trained NeRF model and a single training image with user-applied color edits IReNe swiftly adjusts network parameters in seconds. This adjustment allows the model to generate new scene views accurately representing the color changes from the training image while also controlling object boundaries and view-specific effects. Object boundary control is achieved by integrating a trainable segmentation module into the model. The process gains efficiency by retraining only the weights of the last network layer. We observed that neurons in this layer can be classified into those responsible for view-dependent appearance and those contributing to diffuse appearance. We introduce an automated classification approach to identify these neuron types and exclusively fine-tune the weights of the diffuse neurons. This further accelerates training and ensures consistent color edits across different views. A thorough validation on a new dataset with edited object colors shows significant quantitative and qualitative advancements over competitors accelerating speeds by 5x and 500x.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mazzucchelli_IReNe_Instant_Recoloring_of_Neural_Radiance_Fields_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Class Tokens Infusion for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Yoon, Sung-Hoon, Kwon, Hoyong, Kim, Hyeonseong, Yoon, Kuk-Jin",Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) relies on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to extract spatial information from image-level labels. With the success of Vision Transformer (ViT) the migration of ViT is actively conducted in WSSS. This work proposes a novel WSSS framework with Class Token Infusion (CTI). By infusing the class tokens from images we guide class tokens to possess class-specific distinct characteristics and global-local consistency. For this we devise two kinds of token infusion: 1) Intra-image Class Token Infusion (I-CTI) and 2) Cross-Image Class Token Infusion (C-CTI). In I-CTI we infuse the class tokens from the same but differently augmented images and thus make CAMs consistent among various deformations (view color). In C-CTI by infusing the class tokens from the other images and imposing the resulting CAMs to be similar it learns class-specific distinct characteristics. Besides the CTI we bring the background (BG) concept into ViT with the BG token to reduce the false positive activation of CAMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets achieving state-of-the-art results in weakly supervised semantic segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/yoon307/CTI,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yoon_Class_Tokens_Infusion_for_Weakly_Supervised_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FedHCA2: Towards Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning,"Lu, Yuxiang, Huang, Suizhi, Yang, Yuwen, Sirejiding, Shalayiding, Ding, Yue, Lu, Hongtao",Federated Learning (FL) enables joint training across distributed clients using their local data privately. Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) builds on FL to handle multiple tasks assuming model congruity that identical model architecture is deployed in each client. To relax this assumption and thus extend real-world applicability we introduce a novel problem setting Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning (HC-FMTL) to accommodate diverse task setups. The main challenge of HC-FMTL is the model incongruity issue that invalidates conventional aggregation methods. It also escalates the difficulties in model aggregation to deal with data and task heterogeneity inherent in FMTL. To address these challenges we propose the FedHCA^2 framework which allows for federated training of personalized models by modeling relationships among heterogeneous clients. Drawing on our theoretical insights into the difference between multi-task and federated optimization we propose the Hyper Conflict-Averse Aggregation scheme to mitigate conflicts during encoder updates. Additionally inspired by task interaction in MTL the Hyper Cross Attention Aggregation scheme uses layer-wise cross attention to enhance decoder interactions while alleviating model incongruity. Moreover we employ learnable Hyper Aggregation Weights for each client to customize personalized parameter updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FedHCA^2 in various HC-FMTL scenarios compared to representative methods. Code is available at https://github.com/innovator-zero/FedHCA2.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lu_FedHCA2_Towards_Hetero-Client_Federated_Multi-Task_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Motion Diversification Networks,"Kim, Hee Jae, Ohn-Bar, Eshed",We introduce Motion Diversification Networks a novel framework for learning to generate realistic and diverse 3D human motion. Despite recent advances in deep generative motion modeling existing models often fail to produce samples that capture the full range of plausible and natural 3D human motion within a given context. The lack of diversity becomes even more apparent in applications where subtle and multi-modal 3D human forecasting is crucial for safety such as robotics and autonomous driving. Towards more realistic and functional 3D motion models we highlight limitations in existing generative modeling techniques particularly in overly simplistic latent code sampling strategies. We then introduce a transformer-based diversification mechanism that learns to effectively guide sampling in the latent space. Our proposed attention-based module queries multiple stochastic samples to flexibly predict a diverse set of latent codes which can be subsequently decoded into motion samples. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art diversity and accuracy prediction performance across a range of benchmarks and settings particularly when used to forecast intricate in-the-wild 3D human motion within complex urban environments. Our models datasets and code are available at https://mdncvpr.github.io/.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kim_Motion_Diversification_Networks_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Telling Left from Right: Identifying Geometry-Aware Semantic Correspondence,"Zhang, Junyi, Herrmann, Charles, Hur, Junhwa, Chen, Eric, Jampani, Varun, Sun, Deqing, Yang, Ming-Hsuan",While pre-trained large-scale vision models have shown significant promise for semantic correspondence their features often struggle to grasp the geometry and orientation of instances. This paper identifies the importance of being geometry-aware for semantic correspondence and reveals a limitation of the features of current foundation models under simple post-processing. We show that incorporating this information can markedly enhance semantic correspondence performance with simple but effective solutions in both zero-shot and supervised settings. We also construct a new challenging benchmark for semantic correspondence built from an existing animal pose estimation dataset for both pre-training validating models. Our method achieves a PCK@0.10 score of 65.4 (zero-shot) and 85.6 (supervised) on the challenging SPair-71k dataset outperforming the state of the art by 5.5p and 11.0p absolute gains respectively. Our code and datasets are publicly available at: https://telling-left-from-right.github.io.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Telling_Left_from_Right_Identifying_Geometry-Aware_Semantic_Correspondence_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PAIR Diffusion: A Comprehensive Multimodal Object-Level Image Editor,"Goel, Vidit, Peruzzo, Elia, Jiang, Yifan, Xu, Dejia, Xu, Xingqian, Sebe, Nicu, Darrell, Trevor, Wang, Zhangyang, Shi, Humphrey",Generative image editing has recently witnessed extremely fast-paced growth. Some works use high-level conditioning such as text while others use low-level conditioning. Nevertheless most of them lack fine-grained control over the properties of the different objects present in the image i.e. object-level image editing. In this work we tackle the task by perceiving the images as an amalgamation of various objects and aim to control the properties of each object in a fine-grained manner. Out of these properties we identify structure and appearance as the most intuitive to understand and useful for editing purposes. We propose PAIR Diffusion a generic framework that enables a diffusion model to control the structure and appearance properties of each object in the image. We show that having control over the properties of each object in an image leads to comprehensive editing capabilities. Our framework allows for various object-level editing operations on real images such as reference image-based appearance editing free-form shape editing adding objects and variations. Thanks to our design we do not require any inversion step. Additionally we propose multimodal classifier-free guidance which enables editing images using both reference images and text when using our approach with foundational diffusion models. We validate the above claims by extensively evaluating our framework on both unconditional and foundational diffusion models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Goel_PAIR_Diffusion_A_Comprehensive_Multimodal_Object-Level_Image_Editor_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
TokenCompose: Text-to-Image Diffusion with Token-level Supervision,"Wang, Zirui, Sha, Zhizhou, Ding, Zheng, Wang, Yilin, Tu, Zhuowen",We present TokenCompose a Latent Diffusion Model for text-to-image generation that achieves enhanced consistency between user-specified text prompts and model-generated images. Despite its tremendous success the standard denoising process in the Latent Diffusion Model takes text prompts as conditions only absent explicit constraint for the consistency between the text prompts and the image contents leading to unsatisfactory results for composing multiple object categories. Our proposed TokenCompose aims to improve multi-category instance composition by introducing the token-wise consistency terms between the image content and object segmentation maps in the finetuning stage. TokenCompose can be applied directly to the existing training pipeline of text-conditioned diffusion models without extra human labeling information. By finetuning Stable Diffusion with our approach the model exhibits significant improvements in multi-category instance composition and enhanced photorealism for its generated images.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_TokenCompose_Text-to-Image_Diffusion_with_Token-level_Supervision_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FINER: Flexible Spectral-bias Tuning in Implicit NEural Representation by Variable-periodic Activation Functions,"Liu, Zhen, Zhu, Hao, Zhang, Qi, Fu, Jingde, Deng, Weibing, Ma, Zhan, Guo, Yanwen, Cao, Xun",Implicit Neural Representation (INR) which utilizes a neural network to map coordinate inputs to corresponding attributes is causing a revolution in the field of signal processing. However current INR techniques suffer from a restricted capability to tune their supported frequency set resulting in imperfect performance when representing complex signals with multiple frequencies. We have identified that this frequency-related problem can be greatly alleviated by introducing variable-periodic activation functions for which we propose FINER. By initializing the bias of the neural network within different ranges sub-functions with various frequencies in the variable-periodic function are selected for activation. Consequently the supported frequency set of FINER can be flexibly tuned leading to improved performance in signal representation. We demonstrate the capabilities of FINER in the contexts of 2D image fitting 3D signed distance field representation and 5D neural radiance fields optimization and we show that it outperforms existing INRs.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_FINER_Flexible_Spectral-bias_Tuning_in_Implicit_NEural_Representation_by_Variable-periodic_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
TextCraftor: Your Text Encoder Can be Image Quality Controller,"Li, Yanyu, Liu, Xian, Kag, Anil, Hu, Ju, Idelbayev, Yerlan, Sagar, Dhritiman, Wang, Yanzhi, Tulyakov, Sergey, Ren, Jian",Diffusion-based text-to-image generative models e.g. Stable Diffusion have revolutionized the field of content generation enabling significant advancements in areas like image editing and video synthesis. Despite their formidable capabilities these models are not without their limitations. It is still challenging to synthesize an image that aligns well with the input text and multiple runs with carefully crafted prompts are required to achieve satisfactory results. To mitigate these limitations numerous studies have endeavored to fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion models i.e.. UNet utilizing various technologies. Yet amidst these efforts a pivotal question of text-to-image diffusion model training has remained largely unexplored: Is it possible and feasible to fine-tune the text encoder to improve the performance of text-to-image diffusion models? Our findings reveal that instead of replacing the CLIP text encoder used in Stable Diffusion with other large language models we can enhance it through our proposed fine-tuning approach TextCraftor leading to substantial improvements in quantitative benchmarks and human assessments. Interestingly our technique also empowers controllable image generation through the interpolation of different text encoders fine-tuned with various rewards. We also demonstrate that TextCraftor is orthogonal to UNet finetuning and can be combined to further improve generative quality.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_TextCraftor_Your_Text_Encoder_Can_be_Image_Quality_Controller_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
IMPRINT: Generative Object Compositing by Learning Identity-Preserving Representation,"Song, Yizhi, Zhang, Zhifei, Lin, Zhe, Cohen, Scott, Price, Brian, Zhang, Jianming, Kim, Soo Ye, Zhang, He, Xiong, Wei, Aliaga, Daniel",Generative object compositing emerges as a promising new avenue for compositional image editing. However the requirement of object identity preservation poses a significant challenge limiting practical usage of most existing methods. In response this paper introduces IMPRINT a novel diffusion-based generative model trained with a two-stage learning framework that decouples learning of identity preservation from that of compositing. The first stage is targeted for context-agnostic identity-preserving pretraining of the object encoder enabling the encoder to learn an embedding that is both view-invariant and conducive to enhanced detail preservation. The subsequent stage leverages this representation to learn seamless harmonization of the object composited to the background. In addition IMPRINT incorporates a shape-guidance mechanism offering user-directed control over the compositing process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMPRINT significantly outperforms existing methods and various baselines on identity preservation and composition quality.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Song_IMPRINT_Generative_Object_Compositing_by_Learning_Identity-Preserving_Representation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Portrait4D: Learning One-Shot 4D Head Avatar Synthesis using Synthetic Data,"Deng, Yu, Wang, Duomin, Ren, Xiaohang, Chen, Xingyu, Wang, Baoyuan",Existing one-shot 4D head synthesis methods usually learn from monocular videos with the aid of 3DMM reconstruction yet the latter is evenly challenging which restricts them from reasonable 4D head synthesis. We present a method to learn one-shot 4D head synthesis via large-scale synthetic data. The key is to first learn a part-wise 4D generative model from monocular images via adversarial learning to synthesize multi-view images of diverse identities and full motions as training data; then leverage a transformer-based animatable triplane reconstructor to learn 4D head reconstruction using the synthetic data. A novel learning strategy is enforced to enhance the generalizability to real images by disentangling the learning process of 3D reconstruction and reenactment. Experiments demonstrate our superiority over the prior art.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Deng_Portrait4D_Learning_One-Shot_4D_Head_Avatar_Synthesis_using_Synthetic_Data_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ConvoFusion: Multi-Modal Conversational Diffusion for Co-Speech Gesture Synthesis,"Mughal, Muhammad Hamza, Dabral, Rishabh, Habibie, Ikhsanul, Donatelli, Lucia, Habermann, Marc, Theobalt, Christian",Gestures play a key role in human communication. Recent methods for co-speech gesture generation while managing to generate beat-aligned motions struggle generating gestures that are semantically aligned with the utterance. Compared to beat gestures that align naturally to the audio signal semantically coherent gestures require modeling the complex interactions between the language and human motion and can be controlled by focusing on certain words. Therefore we present ConvoFusion a diffusion-based approach for multi-modal gesture synthesis which can not only generate gestures based on multi-modal speech inputs but can also facilitate controllability in gesture synthesis. Our method proposes two guidance objectives that allow the users to modulate the impact of different conditioning modalities (e.g. audio vs text) as well as to choose certain words to be emphasized during gesturing. Our method is versatile in that it can be trained either for generating monologue gestures or even the conversational gestures. To further advance the research on multi-party interactive gestures the DnD Group Gesture dataset is released which contains 6 hours of gesture data showing 5 people interacting with one another. We compare our method with several recent works and demonstrate effectiveness of our method on a variety of tasks. We urge the reader to watch our supplementary video at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/ConvoFusion/.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mughal_ConvoFusion_Multi-Modal_Conversational_Diffusion_for_Co-Speech_Gesture_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Boosting Neural Representations for Videos with a Conditional Decoder,"Zhang, Xinjie, Yang, Ren, He, Dailan, Ge, Xingtong, Xu, Tongda, Wang, Yan, Qin, Hongwei, Zhang, Jun",Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach for video storage and processing showing remarkable versatility across various video tasks. However existing methods often fail to fully leverage their representation capabilities primarily due to inadequate alignment of intermediate features during target frame decoding. This paper introduces a universal boosting framework for current implicit video representation approaches. Specifically we utilize a conditional decoder with a temporal-aware affine transform module which uses the frame index as a prior condition to effectively align intermediate features with target frames. Besides we introduce a sinusoidal NeRV-like block to generate diverse intermediate features and achieve a more balanced parameter distribution thereby enhancing the model's capacity. With a high-frequency information-preserving reconstruction loss our approach successfully boosts multiple baseline INRs in the reconstruction quality and convergence speed for video regression and exhibits superior inpainting and interpolation results. Further we integrate a consistent entropy minimization technique and develop video codecs based on these boosted INRs. Experiments on the UVG dataset confirm that our enhanced codecs significantly outperform baseline INRs and offer competitive rate-distortion performance compared to traditional and learning-based codecs. Code is available at https://github.com/Xinjie-Q/Boosting-NeRV.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Boosting_Neural_Representations_for_Videos_with_a_Conditional_Decoder_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
From Audio to Photoreal Embodiment: Synthesizing Humans in Conversations,"Ng, Evonne, Romero, Javier, Bagautdinov, Timur, Bai, Shaojie, Darrell, Trevor, Kanazawa, Angjoo, Richard, Alexander",We present a framework for generating full-bodied photorealistic avatars that gesture according to the conversational dynamics of a dyadic interaction. Given speech audio we output multiple possibilities of gestural motion for an individual including face body and hands. The key behind our method is in combining the benefits of sample diversity from vector quantization with the high-frequency details obtained through diffusion to generate more dynamic expressive motion. We visualize the generated motion using highly photorealistic avatars that can express crucial nuances in gestures (e.g. sneers and smirks). To facilitate this line of research we introduce a first-of-its-kind multi-view conversational dataset that allows for photorealistic reconstruction. Experiments show our model generates appropriate and diverse gestures outperforming both diffusion- and VQ-only methods. Furthermore our perceptual evaluation highlights the importance of photorealism (vs. meshes) in accurately assessing subtle motion details in conversational gestures. Code and dataset available on project page.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ng_From_Audio_to_Photoreal_Embodiment_Synthesizing_Humans_in_Conversations_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Single-View Scene Point Cloud Human Grasp Generation,"Wang, Yan-Kang, Xing, Chengyi, Wei, Yi-Lin, Wu, Xiao-Ming, Zheng, Wei-Shi",In this work we explore a novel task of generating human grasps based on single-view scene point clouds which more accurately mirrors the typical real-world situation of observing objects from a single viewpoint. Due to the incompleteness of object point clouds and the presence of numerous scene points the generated hand is prone to penetrating into the invisible parts of the object and the model is easily affected by scene points. Thus we introduce S2HGrasp a framework composed of two key modules: the Global Perception module that globally perceives partial object point clouds and the DiffuGrasp module designed to generate high-quality human grasps based on complex inputs that include scene points. Additionally we introduce S2HGD dataset which comprises approximately 99000 single-object single-view scene point clouds of 1668 unique objects each annotated with one human grasp. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that S2HGrasp can not only generate natural human grasps regardless of scene points but also effectively prevent penetration between the hand and invisible parts of the object. Moreover our model showcases strong generalization capability when applied to unseen objects. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/S2HGrasp.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Single-View_Scene_Point_Cloud_Human_Grasp_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
One-step Diffusion with Distribution Matching Distillation,"Yin, Tianwei, Gharbi, Micha√´l, Zhang, Richard, Shechtman, Eli, Durand, Fr√©do, Freeman, William T., Park, Taesung",Diffusion models generate high-quality images but require dozens of forward passes. We introduce Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) a procedure to transform a diffusion model into a one-step image generator with minimal impact on image quality. We enforce the one-step image generator match the diffusion model at distribution level by minimizing an approximate KL divergence whose gradient can be expressed as the difference between 2 score functions one of the target distribution and the other of the synthetic distribution being produced by our one-step generator. The score functions are parameterized as two diffusion models trained separately on each distribution. Combined with a simple regression loss matching the large-scale structure of the multi-step diffusion outputs our method outperforms all published few-step diffusion approaches reaching 2.62 FID on ImageNet 64x64 and 11.49 FID on zero-shot COCO-30k comparable to Stable Diffusion but orders of magnitude faster. Utilizing FP16 inference our model can generate images at 20 FPS on modern hardware.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yin_One-step_Diffusion_with_Distribution_Matching_Distillation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Rethinking Human Motion Prediction with Symplectic Integral,"Chen, Haipeng, Lyu, Kedi, Liu, Zhenguang, Yin, Yifang, Yang, Xun, Lyu, Yingda",Long-term and accurate forecasting is the long-standing pursuit of the human motion prediction task. Existing methods typically suffer from dramatic degradation in prediction accuracy with the increasing prediction horizon. It comes down to two reasons:1? Insufficient numerical stability.Unforeseen high noise and complex feature relationships in the data. 2? Inadequate modeling stability. Unreasonable step sizes and undesirable parameter updates in the prediction.In this paper we design a novel and symplectic integral-inspired framework named symplectic integral neural network (SINN) which engages symplectic trajectories to optimize the pose representation and employs a stable symplectic operator to alternately model the dynamic context. Specifically we design a Symplectic Representation Encoder that performs on enhanced human pose representation to obtain trajectories on the symplectic manifold ensuring numerical stability based on Hamiltonian mechanics and symplectic spatial splitting algorithm. We further present the Symplectic Temporal Aggregation module in the light of the symplectic temporal splitting algorithm which splits the long-term prediction into multiple accurate short-term predictions generated by a symplectic operator to secure modeling stability. Moreover our approach is model-agnostic and can be efficiently integrated with different physical dynamics models.The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art outperforming existing methods by large margins:20.1%on Human3.6M16.7%on CUM Mocap and 10.2% on 3DPW.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Rethinking_Human_Motion_Prediction_with_Symplectic_Integral_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CPGA: Coding Priors-Guided Aggregation Network for Compressed Video Quality Enhancement,"Zhu, Qiang, Hao, Jinhua, Ding, Yukang, Liu, Yu, Mo, Qiao, Sun, Ming, Zhou, Chao, Zhu, Shuyuan",Recently numerous approaches have achieved notable success in compressed video quality enhancement (VQE). However these methods usually ignore the utilization of valuable coding priors inherently embedded in compressed videos such as motion vectors and residual frames which carry abundant temporal and spatial information. To remedy this problem we propose the Coding Priors-Guided Aggregation (CPGA) network to utilize temporal and spatial information from coding priors. The CPGA mainly consists of an inter-frame temporal aggregation (ITA) module and a multi-scale non-local aggregation (MNA) module. Specifically the ITA module aggregates temporal information from consecutive frames and coding priors while the MNA module globally captures spatial information guided by residual frames. In addition to facilitate research in VQE task we newly construct the Video Coding Priors (VCP) dataset comprising 300 videos with various coding priors extracted from corresponding bitstreams. It remedies the shortage of previous datasets on the lack of coding information. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/VQE-CPGA/CPGA.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_CPGA_Coding_Priors-Guided_Aggregation_Network_for_Compressed_Video_Quality_Enhancement_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MicroCinema: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach for Text-to-Video Generation,"Wang, Yanhui, Bao, Jianmin, Weng, Wenming, Feng, Ruoyu, Yin, Dacheng, Yang, Tao, Zhang, Jingxu, Dai, Qi, Zhao, Zhiyuan, Wang, Chunyu, Qiu, Kai, Yuan, Yuhui, Sun, Xiaoyan, Luo, Chong, Guo, Baining",We present MicroCinema a straightforward yet effective framework for high-quality and coherent text-to-video generation. Unlike existing approaches that align text prompts with video directly MicroCinema introduces a Divide-and-Conquer strategy which divides the text-to-video into a two-stage process: text-to-image generation and image&text-to-video generation. This strategy offers two significant advantages. a) It allows us to take full advantage of the recent advances in text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion Midjourney and DALLE to generate photorealistic and highly detailed images. b) Leveraging the generated image the model can allocate less focus to fine-grained appearance details prioritizing the efficient learning of motion dynamics. To implement this strategy effectively we introduce two core designs. First we propose the Appearance Injection Network enhancing the preservation of the appearance of the given image. Second we introduce the Appearance Noise Prior a novel mechanism aimed at maintaining the capabilities of pre-trained 2D diffusion models. These design elements empower MicroCinema to generate high-quality videos with precise motion guided by the provided text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. Concretely MicroCinema achieves SOTA zero-shot FVD of 342.86 on UCF-101 and 377.40 on MSR-VTT.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_MicroCinema_A_Divide-and-Conquer_Approach_for_Text-to-Video_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Structure Matters: Tackling the Semantic Discrepancy in Diffusion Models for Image Inpainting,"Liu, Haipeng, Wang, Yang, Qian, Biao, Wang, Meng, Rui, Yong",Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for image inpainting aim to add the noise to the texture of the image during the forward process and recover the masked regions with the unmasked ones of the texture via the reverse denoising process. Despite the meaningful semantics generation the existing arts suffer from the semantic discrepancy between the masked and unmasked regions since the semantically dense unmasked texture fails to be completely degraded while the masked regions turn to the pure noise in diffusion process leading to the large discrepancy between them. In this paper we aim to answer how the unmasked semantics guide the texture denoising process; together with how to tackle the semantic discrepancy to facilitate the consistent and meaningful semantics generation. To this end we propose a novel structure-guided diffusion model for image inpainting named StrDiffusion to reformulate the conventional texture denoising process under the structure guidance to derive a simplified denoising objective for image inpainting while revealing: 1) the semantically sparse structure is beneficial to tackle the semantic discrepancy in the early stage while the dense texture generates the reasonable semantics in the late stage; 2) the semantics from the unmasked regions essentially offer the time-dependent structure guidance for the texture denoising process benefiting from the time-dependent sparsity of the structure semantics. For the denoising process a structure-guided neural network is trained to estimate the simplified denoising objective by exploiting the consistency of the denoised structure between masked and unmasked regions. Besides we devise an adaptive resampling strategy as a formal criterion as whether the structure is competent to guide the texture denoising process while regulate their semantic correlations. Extensive experiments validate the merits of StrDiffusion over the state-of-the-arts. Our code is available at https://github.com/htyjers/StrDiffusion.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Structure_Matters_Tackling_the_Semantic_Discrepancy_in_Diffusion_Models_for_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Makeup Prior Models for 3D Facial Makeup Estimation and Applications,"Yang, Xingchao, Taketomi, Takafumi, Endo, Yuki, Kanamori, Yoshihiro",In this work we introduce two types of makeup prior models to extend existing 3D face prior models: PCA-based and StyleGAN2-based priors. The PCA-based prior model is a linear model that is easy to construct and is computationally efficient. However it retains only low-frequency information. Conversely the StyleGAN2-based model can represent high-frequency information with relatively higher computational cost than the PCA-based model. Although there is a trade-off between the two models both are applicable to 3D facial makeup estimation and related applications. By leveraging makeup prior models and designing a makeup consistency module we effectively address the challenges that previous methods faced in robustly estimating makeup particularly in the context of handling self-occluded faces. In experiments we demonstrate that our approach reduces computational costs by several orders of magnitude achieving speeds up to 180 times faster. In addition by improving the accuracy of the estimated makeup we confirm that our methods are highly advantageous for various 3D facial makeup applications such as 3D makeup face reconstruction user-friendly makeup editing makeup transfer and interpolation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yang_Makeup_Prior_Models_for_3D_Facial_Makeup_Estimation_and_Applications_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
I'M HOI: Inertia-aware Monocular Capture of 3D Human-Object Interactions,"Zhao, Chengfeng, Zhang, Juze, Du, Jiashen, Shan, Ziwei, Wang, Junye, Yu, Jingyi, Wang, Jingya, Xu, Lan","We are living in a world surrounded by diverse and ""smart"" devices with rich modalities of sensing ability. Conveniently capturing the interactions between us humans and these objects remains far-reaching. In this paper we present I'm-HOI a monocular scheme to faithfully capture the 3D motions of both the human and object in a novel setting: using a minimal amount of RGB camera and object-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). It combines general motion inference and category-aware refinement. For the former we introduce a holistic human-object tracking method to fuse the IMU signals and the RGB stream and progressively recover the human motions and subsequently the companion object motions. For the latter we tailor a category-aware motion diffusion model which is conditioned on both the raw IMU observations and the results from the previous stage under over-parameterization representation. It significantly refines the initial results and generates vivid body hand and object motions. Moreover we contribute a large dataset with ground truth human and object motions dense RGB inputs and rich object-mounted IMU measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of I'm-HOI under a hybrid capture setting. Our dataset and code will be released to the community.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhao_IM_HOI_Inertia-aware_Monocular_Capture_of_3D_Human-Object_Interactions_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Dynamic Policy-Driven Adaptive Multi-Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification,"Zheng, Tingting, Jiang, Kui, Yao, Hongxun",Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) has shown impressive performance for histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis using bags or pseudo-bags. It involves instance sampling feature representation and decision-making. However existing MIL-based technologies at least suffer from one or more of the following problems: 1) requiring high storage and intensive pre-processing for numerous instances (sampling); 2) potential over-fitting with limited knowledge to predict bag labels (feature representation); 3) pseudo-bag counts and prior biases affect model robustness and generalizability (decision-making). Inspired by clinical diagnostics using the past sampling instances can facilitate the final WSI analysis but it is barely explored in prior technologies. To break free these limitations we integrate the dynamic instance sampling and reinforcement learning into a unified framework to improve the instance selection and feature aggregation forming a novel Dynamic Policy Instance Selection (DPIS) scheme for better and more credible decision-making. Specifically the measurement of feature distance and reward function are employed to boost continuous instance sampling. To alleviate the over-fitting we explore the latent global relations among instances for more robust and discriminative feature representation while establishing reward and punishment mechanisms to correct biases in pseudo-bags using contrastive learning. These strategies form the final Dynamic Policy-Driven Adaptive Multi-Instance Learning (PAMIL) method for WSI tasks. Extensive experiments reveal that our PAMIL method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.8% on CAMELYON16 and 4.4% on TCGA lung cancer datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zheng_Dynamic_Policy-Driven_Adaptive_Multi-Instance_Learning_for_Whole_Slide_Image_Classification_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
LiDAR4D: Dynamic Neural Fields for Novel Space-time View LiDAR Synthesis,"Zheng, Zehan, Lu, Fan, Xue, Weiyi, Chen, Guang, Jiang, Changjun",Although neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved triumphs in image novel view synthesis (NVS) LiDAR NVS remains largely unexplored. Previous LiDAR NVS methods employ a simple shift from image NVS methods while ignoring the dynamic nature and the large-scale reconstruction problem of LiDAR point clouds. In light of this we propose LiDAR4D a differentiable LiDAR-only framework for novel space-time LiDAR view synthesis. In consideration of the sparsity and large-scale characteristics we design a 4D hybrid representation combined with multi-planar and grid features to achieve effective reconstruction in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore we introduce geometric constraints derived from point clouds to improve temporal consistency. For the realistic synthesis of LiDAR point clouds we incorporate the global optimization of ray-drop probability to preserve cross-region patterns. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and NuScenes datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in accomplishing geometry-aware and time-consistent dynamic reconstruction.

Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Generalizable Dense Prediction,"Lee, Hsin-Ying, Tseng, Hung-Yu, Lee, Hsin-Ying, Yang, Ming-Hsuan",Contents generated by recent advanced Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models are sometimes too imaginative for existing off-the-shelf dense predictors to estimate due to the immitigable domain gap. We introduce DMP a pipeline utilizing pre-trained T2I models as a prior for dense prediction tasks. To address the misalignment between deterministic prediction tasks and stochastic T2I models we reformulate the diffusion process through a sequence of interpolations establishing a deterministic mapping between input RGB images and output prediction distributions. To preserve generalizability we use low-rank adaptation to fine-tune pre-trained models. Extensive experiments across five tasks including 3D property estimation semantic segmentation and intrinsic image decomposition showcase the efficacy of the proposed method. Despite limited-domain training data the approach yields faithful estimations for arbitrary images surpassing existing state-of-the-art algorithms.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_Exploiting_Diffusion_Prior_for_Generalizable_Dense_Prediction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Orthogonal Adaptation for Modular Customization of Diffusion Models,"Po, Ryan, Yang, Guandao, Aberman, Kfir, Wetzstein, Gordon",Customization techniques for text-to-image models have paved the way for a wide range of previously unattainable applications enabling the generation of specific concepts across diverse contexts and styles. While existing methods facilitate high-fidelity customization for individual concepts or a limited pre-defined set of them they fall short of achieving scalability where a single model can seamlessly render countless concepts. In this paper we address a new problem called Modular Customization with the goal of efficiently merging customized models that were fine-tuned independently for individual concepts. This allows the merged model to jointly synthesize concepts in one image without compromising fidelity or incurring any additional computational costs. To address this problem we introduce Orthogonal Adaptation a method designed to encourage the customized models which do not have access to each other during fine-tuning to have orthogonal residual weights. This ensures that during inference time the customized models can be summed with minimal interference. Our proposed method is both simple and versatile applicable to nearly all optimizable weights in the model architecture. Through an extensive set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations our method consistently outperforms relevant baselines in terms of efficiency and identity preservation demonstrating a significant leap toward scalable customization of diffusion models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Po_Orthogonal_Adaptation_for_Modular_Customization_of_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Optimizing Diffusion Noise Can Serve As Universal Motion Priors,"Karunratanakul, Korrawe, Preechakul, Konpat, Aksan, Emre, Beeler, Thabo, Suwajanakorn, Supasorn, Tang, Siyu",We propose Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO) a new method that effectively leverages existing motion diffusion models as motion priors for a wide range of motion-related tasks. Instead of training a task-specific diffusion model for each new task DNO operates by optimizing the diffusion latent noise of an existing pre-trained text-to-motion model. Given the corresponding latent noise of a human motion it propagates the gradient from the target criteria defined on the motion space through the whole denoising process to update the diffusion latent noise. As a result DNO supports any use cases where criteria can be defined as a function of motion. In particular we show that for motion editing and control DNO outperforms existing methods in both achieving the objective and preserving the motion content. DNO accommodates a diverse range of editing modes including changing trajectory pose joint locations or avoiding newly added obstacles. In addition DNO is effective in motion denoising and completion producing smooth and realistic motion from noisy and partial inputs. DNO achieves these results at inference time without the need for model retraining offering great versatility for any defined reward or loss function on the motion representation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Karunratanakul_Optimizing_Diffusion_Noise_Can_Serve_As_Universal_Motion_Priors_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
OVFoodSeg: Elevating Open-Vocabulary Food Image Segmentation via Image-Informed Textual Representation,"Wu, Xiongwei, Yu, Sicheng, Lim, Ee-Peng, Ngo, Chong-Wah",In the realm of food computing segmenting ingredients from images poses substantial challenges due to the large intra-class variance among the same ingredients the emergence of new ingredients and the high annotation costs associated with large food segmentation datasets. Existing approaches primarily utilize a closed-vocabulary and static text embeddings setting. These methods often fall short in effectively handling the ingredients particularly new and diverse ones. In response to these limitations we introduce OVFoodSeg a framework that adopts an open-vocabulary setting and enhances text embeddings with visual context. By integrating vision-language models (VLMs) our approach enriches text embedding with image-specific information through two innovative modules e.g. an image-to-text learner FoodLearner and an Image-Informed Text Encoder. The training process of OVFoodSeg is divided into two stages: the pre-training of FoodLearner and the subsequent learning phase for segmentation. The pre-training phase equips FoodLearner with the capability to align visual information with corresponding textual representations that are specifically related to food while the second phase adapts both the FoodLearner and the Image-Informed Text Encoder for the segmentation task. By addressing the deficiencies of previous models OVFoodSeg demonstrates a significant improvement achieving an 4.9% increase in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on the FoodSeg103 dataset setting a new milestone for food image segmentation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wu_OVFoodSeg_Elevating_Open-Vocabulary_Food_Image_Segmentation_via_Image-Informed_Textual_Representation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
XFeat: Accelerated Features for Lightweight Image Matching,"Potje, Guilherme, Cadar, Felipe, Araujo, Andr√©, Martins, Renato, Nascimento, Erickson R.",We introduce a lightweight and accurate architecture for resource-efficient visual correspondence. Our method dubbed XFeat (Accelerated Features) revisits fundamental design choices in convolutional neural networks for detecting extracting and matching local features. Our new model satisfies a critical need for fast and robust algorithms suitable to resource-limited devices. In particular accurate image matching requires sufficiently large image resolutions -- for this reason we keep the resolution as large as possible while limiting the number of channels in the network. Besides our model is designed to offer the choice of matching at the sparse or semi-dense levels each of which may be more suitable for different downstream applications such as visual navigation and augmented reality. Our model is the first to offer semi-dense matching efficiently leveraging a novel match refinement module that relies on coarse local descriptors. XFeat is versatile and hardware-independent surpassing current deep learning-based local features in speed (up to 5x faster) with comparable or better accuracy proven in pose estimation and visual localization. We showcase it running in real-time on an inexpensive laptop CPU without specialized hardware optimizations. Code and weights are available at verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/descriptors/xfeat_cvpr24.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Potje_XFeat_Accelerated_Features_for_Lightweight_Image_Matching_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
VideoRF: Rendering Dynamic Radiance Fields as 2D Feature Video Streams,"Wang, Liao, Yao, Kaixin, Guo, Chengcheng, Zhang, Zhirui, Hu, Qiang, Yu, Jingyi, Xu, Lan, Wu, Minye",Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) excel in photorealistically rendering static scenes. However rendering dynamic long-duration radiance fields on ubiquitous devices remains challenging due to data storage and computational constraints. In this paper we introduce VideoRF the first approach to enable real-time streaming and rendering of dynamic human-centric radiance fields on mobile platforms. At the core is a serialized 2D feature image stream representing the 4D radiance field all in one. We introduce a tailored training scheme directly applied to this 2D domain to impose the temporal and spatial redundancy of the feature image stream. By leveraging the redundancy we show that the feature image stream can be efficiently compressed by 2D video codecs which allows us to exploit video hardware accelerators to achieve real-time decoding. On the other hand based on the feature image stream we propose a novel rendering pipeline for VideoRF which has specialized space mappings to query radiance properties efficiently. Paired with a deferred shading model VideoRF has the capability of real-time rendering on mobile devices thanks to its efficiency. We have developed a real-time interactive player that enables online streaming and rendering of dynamic scenes offering a seamless and immersive free-viewpoint experience across a range of devices from desktops to mobile phones.

DPHMs: Diffusion Parametric Head Models for Depth-based Tracking,"Tang, Jiapeng, Dai, Angela, Nie, Yinyu, Markhasin, Lev, Thies, Justus, Nie√üner, Matthias",We introduce Diffusion Parametric Head Models (DPHMs) a generative model that enables robust volumetric head reconstruction and tracking from monocular depth sequences. While recent volumetric head models such as NPHMs can now excel in representing high-fidelity head geometries tracking and reconstructing heads from real-world single-view depth sequences remains very challenging as the fitting to partial and noisy observations is underconstrained. To tackle these challenges we propose a latent diffusion-based prior to regularize volumetric head reconstruction and tracking. This prior-based regularizer effectively constrains the identity and expression codes to lie on the underlying latent manifold which represents plausible head shapes. To evaluate the effectiveness of the diffusion-based prior we collect a dataset of monocular Kinect sequences consisting of various complex facial expression motions and rapid transitions. We compare our method to state-of-the-art tracking methods and demonstrate improved head identity reconstruction as well as robust expression tracking.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Tang_DPHMs_Diffusion_Parametric_Head_Models_for_Depth-based_Tracking_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DetDiffusion: Synergizing Generative and Perceptive Models for Enhanced Data Generation and Perception,"Wang, Yibo, Gao, Ruiyuan, Chen, Kai, Zhou, Kaiqiang, Cai, Yingjie, Hong, Lanqing, Li, Zhenguo, Jiang, Lihui, Yeung, Dit-Yan, Xu, Qiang, Zhang, Kai",Current perceptive models heavily depend on resource-intensive datasets prompting the need for innovative solutions. Leveraging recent advances in diffusion models synthetic data by constructing image inputs from various annotations proves beneficial for downstream tasks. While prior methods have separately addressed generative and perceptive models DetDiffusion for the first time harmonizes both tackling the challenges in generating effective data for perceptive models. To enhance image generation with perceptive models we introduce perception-aware loss (P.A. loss) through segmentation improving both quality and controllability. To boost the performance of specific perceptive models our method customizes data augmentation by extracting and utilizing perception-aware attribute (P.A. Attr) during generation. Experimental results from the object detection task highlight DetDiffusion's superior performance establishing a new state-of-the-art in layout-guided generation. Furthermore image syntheses from DetDiffusion can effectively augment training data significantly enhancing downstream detection performance.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_DetDiffusion_Synergizing_Generative_and_Perceptive_Models_for_Enhanced_Data_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Perception-Oriented Video Frame Interpolation via Asymmetric Blending,"Wu, Guangyang, Tao, Xin, Li, Changlin, Wang, Wenyi, Liu, Xiaohong, Zheng, Qingqing",Previous methods for Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) have encountered challenges notably the manifestation of blur and ghosting effects. These issues can be traced back to two pivotal factors: unavoidable motion errors and misalignment in supervision. In practice motion estimates often prove to be error-prone resulting in misaligned features. Furthermore the reconstruction loss tends to bring blurry results particularly in misaligned regions. To mitigate these challenges we propose a new paradigm called PerVFI (Perception-oriented Video Frame Interpolation). Our approach incorporates an Asymmetric Synergistic Blending module (ASB) that utilizes features from both sides to synergistically blend intermediate features. One reference frame emphasizes primary content while the other contributes complementary information. To impose a stringent constraint on the blending process we introduce a self-learned sparse quasi-binary mask which effectively mitigates ghosting and blur artifacts in the output. Additionally we employ a normalizing flow-based generator and utilize the negative log-likelihood loss to learn the conditional distribution of the output which further facilitates the generation of clear and fine details. Experimental results validate the superiority of PerVFI demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality compared to existing methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/mulns/PerVFI,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wu_Perception-Oriented_Video_Frame_Interpolation_via_Asymmetric_Blending_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DUDF: Differentiable Unsigned Distance Fields with Hyperbolic Scaling,"Fainstein, Miguel, Siless, Viviana, Iarussi, Emmanuel",In recent years there has been a growing interest in training Neural Networks to approximate Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) for representing open surfaces in the context of 3D reconstruction. However UDFs are non-differentiable at the zero level set which leads to significant errors in distances and gradients generally resulting in fragmented and discontinuous surfaces. In this paper we propose to learn a hyperbolic scaling of the unsigned distance field which defines a new Eikonal problem with distinct boundary conditions. This allows our formulation to integrate seamlessly with state-of-the-art continuously differentiable implicit neural representation networks largely applied in the literature to represent signed distance fields. Our approach not only addresses the challenge of open surface representation but also demonstrates significant improvement in reconstruction quality and training performance. Moreover the unlocked field's differentiability allows the accurate computation of essential topological properties such as normal directions and curvatures pervasive in downstream tasks such as rendering. Through extensive experiments we validate our approach across various data sets and against competitive baselines. The results demonstrate enhanced accuracy and up to an order of magnitude increase in speed compared to previous methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Fainstein_DUDF_Differentiable_Unsigned_Distance_Fields_with_Hyperbolic_Scaling_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
2S-UDF: A Novel Two-stage UDF Learning Method for Robust Non-watertight Model Reconstruction from Multi-view Images,"Deng, Junkai, Hou, Fei, Chen, Xuhui, Wang, Wencheng, He, Ying",Recently building on the foundation of neural radiance field various techniques have emerged to learn unsigned distance fields (UDF) to reconstruct 3D non-watertight models from multi-view images. Yet a central challenge in UDF-based volume rendering is formulating a proper way to convert unsigned distance values into volume density ensuring that the resulting weight function remains unbiased and sensitive to occlusions. Falling short on these requirements often results in incorrect topology or large reconstruction errors in resulting models. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a novel two-stage algorithm 2S-UDF for learning a high-quality UDF from multi-view images. Initially the method applies an easily trainable density function that while slightly biased and transparent aids in coarse reconstruction. The subsequent stage then refines the geometry and appearance of the object to achieve a high-quality reconstruction by directly adjusting the weight function used in volume rendering to ensure that it is unbiased and occlusion-aware. Decoupling density and weight in two stages makes our training stable and robust distinguishing our technique from existing UDF learning approaches. Evaluations on the DeepFashion3D DTU and BlendedMVS datasets validate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed approach. In both quantitative metrics and visual quality the results indicate our superior performance over other UDF learning techniques in reconstructing 3D non-watertight models from multi-view images.

UniVS: Unified and Universal Video Segmentation with Prompts as Queries,"Li, Minghan, Li, Shuai, Zhang, Xindong, Zhang, Lei",Despite the recent advances in unified image segmentation (IS) developing a unified video segmentation (VS) model remains a challenge. This is mainly because generic category-specified VS tasks need to detect all objects and track them across consecutive frames while prompt-guided VS tasks require re-identifying the target with visual/text prompts throughout the entire video making it hard to handle the different tasks with the same architecture. We make an attempt to address these issues and present a novel unified VS architecture namely UniVS by using prompts as queries. UniVS averages the prompt features of the target from previous frames as its initial query to explicitly decode masks and introduces a target-wise prompt cross-attention layer in the mask decoder to integrate prompt features in the memory pool. By taking the predicted masks of entities from previous frames as their visual prompts UniVS converts different VS tasks into prompt-guided target segmentation eliminating the heuristic inter-frame matching process. Our framework not only unifies the different VS tasks but also naturally achieves universal training and testing ensuring robust performance across different scenarios. UniVS shows a commendable balance between performance and universality on 10 challenging VS benchmarks covering video instance semantic panoptic object and referring segmentation tasks.

Efficiently Assemble Normalization Layers and Regularization for Federated Domain Generalization,"Le, Khiem, Ho, Long, Do, Cuong, Le-Phuoc, Danh, Wong, Kok-Seng",Domain shift is a formidable issue in Machine Learning that causes a model to suffer from performance degradation when tested on unseen domains. Federated Domain Generalization (FedDG) attempts to train a global model using collaborative clients in a privacy-preserving manner that can generalize well to unseen clients possibly with domain shift. However most existing FedDG methods either cause additional privacy risks of data leakage or induce significant costs in client communication and computation which are major concerns in the Federated Learning paradigm. To circumvent these challenges here we introduce a novel architectural method for FedDG namely gPerXAN which relies on a normalization scheme working with a guiding regularizer. In particular we carefully design Personalized eXplicitly Assembled Normalization to enforce client models selectively filtering domain-specific features that are biased towards local data while retaining discrimination of those features. Then we incorporate a simple yet effective regularizer to guide these models in directly capturing domain-invariant representations that the global model's classifier can leverage. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets i.e. PACS and Office-Home and a real-world medical dataset Camelyon17 indicate that our proposed method outperforms other existing methods in addressing this particular problem.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Le_Efficiently_Assemble_Normalization_Layers_and_Regularization_for_Federated_Domain_Generalization_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Depth Information Assisted Collaborative Mutual Promotion Network for Single Image Dehazing,"Zhang, Yafei, Zhou, Shen, Li, Huafeng",Recovering a clear image from a single hazy image is an open inverse problem. Although significant research progress has been made most existing methods ignore the effect that downstream tasks play in promoting upstream dehazing. From the perspective of the haze generation mechanism there is a potential relationship between the depth information of the scene and the hazy image. Based on this we propose a dual-task collaborative mutual promotion framework to achieve the dehazing of a single image. This framework integrates depth estimation and dehazing by a dual-task interaction mechanism and achieves mutual enhancement of their performance. To realize the joint optimization of the two tasks an alternative implementation mechanism with the difference perception is developed. On the one hand the difference perception between the depth maps of the dehazing result and the ideal image is proposed to promote the dehazing network to pay attention to the non-ideal areas of the dehazing. On the other hand by improving the depth estimation performance in the difficult-to-recover areas of the hazy image the dehazing network can explicitly use the depth information of the hazy image to assist the clear image recovery. To promote the depth estimation we propose to use the difference between the dehazed image and the ground truth to guide the depth estimation network to focus on the dehazed unideal areas. It allows dehazing and depth estimation to leverage their strengths in a mutually reinforcing manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than that of the state-of-the-art approaches.

Unlocking the Potential of Pre-trained Vision Transformers for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation through Relationship Descriptors,"Zhou, Ziqin, Xu, Hai-Ming, Shu, Yangyang, Liu, Lingqiao","The recent advent of pre-trained vision transformers has unveiled a promising property: their inherent capability to group semantically related visual concepts. In this paper we explore to harnesses this emergent feature to tackle few-shot semantic segmentation a task focused on classifying pixels in a test image with a few example data. A critical hurdle in this endeavor is preventing overfitting to the limited classes seen during training the few-shot segmentation model. As our main discovery we find that the concept of ""relationship descriptors"" initially conceived for enhancing the CLIP model for zero-shot semantic segmentation offers a potential solution. We adapt and refine this concept to craft a relationship descriptor construction tailored for few-shot semantic segmentation extending its application across multiple layers to enhance performance. Building upon this adaptation we proposed a few-shot semantic segmentation framework that is not only easy to implement and train but also effectively scales with the number of support examples and categories. Through rigorous experimentation across various datasets including PASCAL-5^ i  and COCO-20^ i  we demonstrate a clear advantage of our method in diverse few-shot semantic segmentation scenarios and a range of pre-trained vision transformer models. The findings clearly show that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques highlighting the effectiveness of harnessing the emerging capabilities of vision transformers for few-shot semantic segmentation.

CustomListener: Text-guided Responsive Interaction for User-friendly Listening Head Generation,"Liu, Xi, Guo, Ying, Zhen, Cheng, Li, Tong, Ao, Yingying, Yan, Pengfei",Listening head generation aims to synthesize a non-verbal responsive listener head by modeling the correlation between the speaker and the listener in dynamic conversion. The applications of listener agent generation in virtual interaction have promoted many works achieving diverse and fine-grained motion generation. However they can only manipulate motions through simple emotional labels but cannot freely control the listener's motions. Since listener agents should have human-like attributes (e.g. identity personality) which can be freely customized by users this limits their realism. In this paper we propose a user-friendly framework called CustomListener to realize the free-form text prior guided listener generation. To achieve speaker-listener coordination we design a Static to Dynamic Portrait module (SDP) which interacts with speaker information to transform static text into dynamic portrait token with completion rhythm and amplitude information. To achieve coherence between segments we design a Past Guided Generation module (PGG) to maintain the consistency of customized listener attributes through the motion prior and utilize a diffusion-based structure conditioned on the portrait token and the motion prior to realize the controllable generation. To train and evaluate our model we have constructed two text-annotated listening head datasets based on ViCo and RealTalk which provide text-video paired labels. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our model.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_CustomListener_Text-guided_Responsive_Interaction_for_User-friendly_Listening_Head_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Fun with Flags: Robust Principal Directions via Flag Manifolds,"Mankovich, Nathan, Camps-Valls, Gustau, Birdal, Tolga",Principal component analysis (PCA) along with its extensions to manifolds and outlier contaminated data have been indispensable in computer vision and machine learning. In this work we present a unifying formalism for PCA and its variants and introduce a framework based on the flags of linear subspaces i.e. a hierarchy of nested linear subspaces of increasing dimension which not only allows for a common implementation but also yields novel variants not explored previously. We begin by generalizing traditional PCA methods that either maximize variance or minimize reconstruction error. We expand these interpretations to develop a wide array of new dimensionality reduction algorithms by accounting for outliers and the data manifold. To devise a common computational approach we recast robust and dual forms of PCA as optimization problems on flag manifolds. We then integrate tangent space approximations of principal geodesic analysis (tangent-PCA) into this flag-based framework creating novel robust and dual geodesic PCA variations. The remarkable flexibility offered by the `flagification' introduced here enables even more algorithmic variants identified by specific flag types. Last but not least we propose an effective convergent solver for these flag-formulations employing the Stiefel manifold. Our empirical results on both real-world and synthetic scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our novel algorithms especially in terms of robustness to outliers on manifolds.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mankovich_Fun_with_Flags_Robust_Principal_Directions_via_Flag_Manifolds_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Generating Non-Stationary Textures using Self-Rectification,"Zhou, Yang, Xiao, Rongjun, Lischinski, Dani, Cohen-Or, Daniel, Huang, Hui","This paper addresses the challenge of example-based non-stationary texture synthesis. We introduce a novel two-step approach wherein users first modify a reference texture using standard image editing tools yielding an initial rough target for the synthesis. Subsequently our proposed method termed ""self-rectification"" automatically refines this target into a coherent seamless texture while faithfully preserving the distinct visual characteristics of the reference exemplar. Our method leverages a pre-trained diffusion network and uses self-attention mechanisms to gradually align the synthesized texture with the reference ensuring the retention of the structures in the provided target. Through experimental validation our approach exhibits exceptional proficiency in handling non-stationary textures demonstrating significant advancements in texture synthesis when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.

SPU-PMD: Self-Supervised Point Cloud Upsampling via Progressive Mesh Deformation,"Liu, Yanzhe, Chen, Rong, Li, Yushi, Li, Yixi, Tan, Xuehou",Despite the success of recent upsampling approaches generating high-resolution point sets with uniform distribution and meticulous structures is still challenging. Unlike existing methods that only take spatial information of the raw data into account we regard point cloud upsampling as generating dense point clouds from deformable topology. Motivated by this we present SPU-PMD a self-supervised topological mesh deformation network for 3D densification. As a cascaded framework our architecture is formulated by a series of coarse mesh interpolator and mesh deformers. At each stage the mesh interpolator first produces the initial dense point clouds via mesh interpolation which allows the model to perceive the primitive topology better. Meanwhile the deformer infers the morphing by estimating the movements of mesh nodes and reconstructs the descriptive topology structure. By associating mesh deformation with feature expansion this module progressively refines point clouds' surface uniformity and structural details. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-scanned 3D data. Also we compare it with state-of-the-art techniques to further illustrate the superiority of our network.

Since video content is highly redundant we argue that naively bringing advances of image models to the video generation domain reduces motion fidelity visual quality and impairs scalability. In this work we build Snap Video a video-first model that systematically addresses these challenges. To do that we first extend the EDM framework to take into account spatially and temporally redundant pixels and naturally support video generation. Second we show that a U-Net--a workhorse behind image generation--scales poorly when generating videos requiring significant computational overhead. Hence we propose a new transformer-based architecture that trains 3.31 times faster than U-Nets (and is  4.5 faster at inference). This allows us to efficiently train a text-to-video model with billions of parameters for the first time reach state-of-the-art results on a number of benchmarks and generate videos with substantially higher quality temporal consistency and motion complexity. The user studies showed that our model was favored by a large margin over the most recent methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Menapace_Snap_Video_Scaled_Spatiotemporal_Transformers_for_Text-to-Video_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
JointSQ: Joint Sparsification-Quantization for Distributed Learning,"Xie, Weiying, Li, Haowei, Ma, Jitao, Li, Yunsong, Lei, Jie, Liu, Donglai, Fang, Leyuan",Gradient sparsification and quantization offer a promising prospect to alleviate the communication overhead problem in distributed learning. However direct combination of the two results in suboptimal solutions due to the fact that sparsification and quantization haven't been learned together. In this paper we propose Joint Sparsification-Quantization (JointSQ) inspired by the discovery that sparsification can be treated as 0-bit quantization regardless of architectures. Specifically we mathematically formulate JointSQ as a mixed-precision quantization problem expanding the solution space. It can be solved by the designed MCKP-Greedy algorithm. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the minimal compression noise of JointSQ and extensive experiments on various network architectures including CNN RNN and Transformer also validate this point. Under the introduction of computation overhead consistent with or even lower than previous methods JointSQ achieves a compression ratio of 1000xon different models while maintaining near-lossless accuracy and brings 1.4xto 2.9xspeedup over existing methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xie_JointSQ_Joint_Sparsification-Quantization_for_Distributed_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
A Unified Framework for Human-centric Point Cloud Video Understanding,"Xu, Yiteng, Ye, Kecheng, Han, Xiao, Ren, Yiming, Zhu, Xinge, Ma, Yuexin",Human-centric Point Cloud Video Understanding (PVU) is an emerging field focused on extracting and interpreting human-related features from sequences of human point clouds further advancing downstream human-centric tasks and applications. Previous works usually focus on tackling one specific task and rely on huge labeled data which has poor generalization capability. Considering that human has specific characteristics including the structural semantics of human body and the dynamics of human motions we propose a unified framework to make full use of the prior knowledge and explore the inherent features in the data itself for generalized human-centric point cloud video understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various human-related tasks including action recognition and 3D pose estimation. All datasets and code will be released soon.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_A_Unified_Framework_for_Human-centric_Point_Cloud_Video_Understanding_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Shadow-Enlightened Image Outpainting,"Yu, Hang, Li, Ruilin, Xie, Shaorong, Qiu, Jiayan",Conventional image outpainting methods usually treat unobserved areas as unknown and extend the scene only in terms of semantic consistency thus overlooking the hidden information in shadows cast by unobserved areas such as the invisible shapes and semantics. In this paper we propose to extract and utilize the hidden information of unobserved areas from their shadows to enhance image outpainting. To this end we propose an end-to-end deep approach that explicitly looks into the shadows within the image. Specifically we extract shadows from the input image and identify instance-level shadow regions cast by the unobserved areas. Then the instance-level shadow representations are concatenated to predict the scene layout of each unobserved instance and outpaint the unobserved areas. Finally two discriminators are implemented to enhance alignment between the extended semantics and their shadows. In the experiments we show that our proposed approach provides complementary cues for outpainting and achieves considerable improvement on all datasets by adopting our approach as a plug-in module.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yu_Shadow-Enlightened_Image_Outpainting_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
BOTH2Hands: Inferring 3D Hands from Both Text Prompts and Body Dynamics,"Zhang, Wenqian, Huang, Molin, Zhou, Yuxuan, Zhang, Juze, Yu, Jingyi, Wang, Jingya, Xu, Lan",The recently emerging text-to-motion advances have spired numerous attempts for convenient and interactive human motion generation. Yet existing methods are largely limited to generating body motions only without considering the rich two-hand motions let alone handling various conditions like body dynamics or texts. To break the data bottleneck we propose BOTH57M a novel multi-modal dataset for two-hand motion generation. Our dataset includes accurate motion tracking for the human body and hands and provides pair-wised finger-level hand annotations and body descriptions. We further provide a strong baseline method BOTH2Hands for the novel task: generating vivid two-hand motions from both implicit body dynamics and explicit text prompts. We first warm up two parallel body-to-hand and text-to-hand diffusion models and then utilize the cross-attention transformer for motion blending. Extensive experiments and cross-validations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and dataset for generating convincing two-hand motions from the hybrid body-and-textual conditions. Our dataset and code will be disseminated to the community for future research which can be found at https://github.com/Godheritage/BOTH2Hands.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_BOTH2Hands_Inferring_3D_Hands_from_Both_Text_Prompts_and_Body_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DreamAvatar: Text-and-Shape Guided 3D Human Avatar Generation via Diffusion Models,"Cao, Yukang, Cao, Yan-Pei, Han, Kai, Shan, Ying, Wong, Kwan-Yee K.","We present DreamAvatar a text-and-shape guided framework for generating high-quality 3D human avatars with controllable poses. While encouraging results have been reported by recent methods on text-guided 3D common object generation generating high-quality human avatars remains an open challenge due to the complexity of the human body's shape pose and appearance. We propose DreamAvatar to tackle this challenge which utilizes a trainable NeRF for predicting density and color for 3D points and pretrained text-to-image diffusion models for providing 2D self-supervision. Specifically we leverage the SMPL model to provide shape and pose guidance for the generation. We introduce a dual-observation-space design that involves the joint optimization of a canonical space and a posed space that are related by a learnable deformation field. This facilitates the generation of more complete textures and geometry faithful to the target pose. We also jointly optimize the losses computed from the full body and from the zoomed-in 3D head to alleviate the common multi-face ""Janus"" problem and improve facial details in the generated avatars. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DreamAvatar significantly outperforms existing methods establishing a new state-of-the-art for text-and-shape guided 3D human avatar generation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cao_DreamAvatar_Text-and-Shape_Guided_3D_Human_Avatar_Generation_via_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Bidirectional Autoregessive Diffusion Model for Dance Generation,"Zhang, Canyu, Tang, Youbao, Zhang, Ning, Lin, Ruei-Sung, Han, Mei, Xiao, Jing, Wang, Song",Dance serves as a powerful medium for expressing human emotions but the lifelike generation of dance is still a considerable challenge. Recently diffusion models have showcased remarkable generative abilities across various domains. They hold promise for human motion generation due to their adaptable many-to-many nature. Nonetheless current diffusion-based motion generation models often create entire motion sequences directly and unidirectionally lacking focus on the motion with local and bidirectional enhancement. When choreographing high-quality dance movements people need to take into account not only the musical context but also the nearby music-aligned dance motions. To authentically capture human behavior we propose a Bidirectional Autoregressive Diffusion Model (BADM) for music-to-dance generation where a bidirectional encoder is built to enforce that the generated dance is harmonious in both the forward and backward directions. To make the generated dance motion smoother a local information decoder is built for local motion enhancement. The proposed framework is able to generate new motions based on the input conditions and nearby motions which foresees individual motion slices iteratively and consolidates all predictions. To further refine the synchronicity between the generated dance and the beat the beat information is incorporated as an input to generate better music-aligned dance movements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing unidirectional approaches on the prominent benchmark for music-to-dance generation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Bidirectional_Autoregessive_Diffusion_Model_for_Dance_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FRESCO: Spatial-Temporal Correspondence for Zero-Shot Video Translation,"Yang, Shuai, Zhou, Yifan, Liu, Ziwei, Loy, Chen Change",The remarkable efficacy of text-to-image diffusion models has motivated extensive exploration of their potential application in video domains. Zero-shot methods seek to extend image diffusion models to videos without necessitating model training. Recent methods mainly focus on incorporating inter-frame correspondence into attention mechanisms. However the soft constraint imposed on determining where to attend to valid features can sometimes be insufficient resulting in temporal inconsistency. In this paper we introduce FRESCO intra-frame correspondence alongside inter-frame correspondence to establish a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This enhancement ensures a more consistent transformation of semantically similar content across frames. Beyond mere attention guidance our approach involves an explicit update of features to achieve high spatial-temporal consistency with the input video significantly improving the visual coherence of the resulting translated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in producing high-quality coherent videos marking a notable improvement over existing zero-shot methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yang_FRESCO_Spatial-Temporal_Correspondence_for_Zero-Shot_Video_Translation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SplattingAvatar: Realistic Real-Time Human Avatars with Mesh-Embedded Gaussian Splatting,"Shao, Zhijing, Wang, Zhaolong, Li, Zhuang, Wang, Duotun, Lin, Xiangru, Zhang, Yu, Fan, Mingming, Wang, Zeyu",We present SplattingAvatar a hybrid 3D representation of photorealistic human avatars with Gaussian Splatting embedded on a triangle mesh which renders over 300 FPS on a modern GPU and 30 FPS on a mobile device. We disentangle the motion and appearance of a virtual human with explicit mesh geometry and implicit appearance modeling with Gaussian Splatting. The Gaussians are defined by barycentric coordinates and displacement on a triangle mesh as Phong surfaces. We extend lifted optimization to simultaneously optimize the parameters of the Gaussians while walking on the triangle mesh. SplattingAvatar is a hybrid representation of virtual humans where the mesh represents low-frequency motion and surface deformation while the Gaussians take over the high-frequency geometry and detailed appearance. Unlike existing deformation methods that rely on an MLP-based linear blend skinning (LBS) field for motion we control the rotation and translation of the Gaussians directly by mesh which empowers its compatibility with various animation techniques e.g. skeletal animation blend shapes and mesh editing. Trainable from monocular videos for both full-body and head avatars SplattingAvatar shows state-of-the-art rendering quality across multiple datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shao_SplattingAvatar_Realistic_Real-Time_Human_Avatars_with_Mesh-Embedded_Gaussian_Splatting_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MoSAR: Monocular Semi-Supervised Model for Avatar Reconstruction using Differentiable Shading,"Dib, Abdallah, Hafemann, Luiz Gustavo, Got, Emeline, Anderson, Trevor, Fadaeinejad, Amin, Cruz, Rafael M. O., Carbonneau, Marc-Andr√©",Reconstructing an avatar from a portrait image has many applications in multimedia but remains a challenging research problem. Extracting reflectance maps and geometry from one image is ill-posed: recovering geometry is a one-to-many mapping problem and reflectance and light are difficult to disentangle. Accurate geometry and reflectance can be captured under the controlled conditions of a light stage but it is costly to acquire large datasets in this fashion. Moreover training solely with this type of data leads to poor generalization with in-the-wild images. This motivates the introduction of MoSAR a method for 3D avatar generation from monocular images. We propose a semi-supervised training scheme that improves generalization by learning from both light stage and in-the-wild datasets. This is achieved using a novel differentiable shading formulation. We show that our approach effectively disentangles the intrinsic face parameters producing relightable avatars. As a result MoSAR estimates a richer set of skin reflectance maps and generates more realistic avatars than existing state-of-the-art methods. We also release a new dataset that provides intrinsic face attributes (diffuse specular ambient occlusion and translucency maps) for 10k subjects.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Dib_MoSAR_Monocular_Semi-Supervised_Model_for_Avatar_Reconstruction_using_Differentiable_Shading_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
RankED: Addressing Imbalance and Uncertainty in Edge Detection Using Ranking-based Losses,"Cetinkaya, Bedrettin, Kalkan, Sinan, Akbas, Emre",Detecting edges in images suffers from the problems of (P1) heavy imbalance between positive and negative classes as well as (P2) label uncertainty owing to disagreement between different annotators. Existing solutions address P1 using class-balanced cross-entropy loss and dice loss and P2 by only predicting edges agreed upon by most annotators. In this paper we propose RankED a unified ranking-based approach that addresses both the imbalance problem (P1) and the uncertainty problem (P2). RankED tackles these two problems with two components: One component which ranks positive pixels over negative pixels and the second which promotes high confidence edge pixels to have more label certainty. We show that RankED outperforms previous studies and sets a new state-of-the-art on NYUD-v2 BSDS500 and Multi-cue datasets. Code is available at https://ranked-cvpr24.github.io.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cetinkaya_RankED_Addressing_Imbalance_and_Uncertainty_in_Edge_Detection_Using_Ranking-based_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DiffHuman: Probabilistic Photorealistic 3D Reconstruction of Humans,"Sengupta, Akash, Alldieck, Thiemo, Kolotouros, Nikos, Corona, Enric, Zanfir, Andrei, Sminchisescu, Cristian",We present DiffHuman a probabilistic method for photorealistic 3D human reconstruction from a single RGB image. Despite the ill-posed nature of this problem most methods are deterministic and output a single solution often resulting in a lack of geometric detail and blurriness in unseen or uncertain regions. In contrast DiffHuman predicts a probability distribution over 3D reconstructions conditioned on an input 2D image which allows us to sample multiple detailed 3D avatars that are consistent with the image. DiffHuman is implemented as a conditional diffusion model that denoises pixel-aligned 2D observations of an underlying 3D shape representation. During inference we may sample 3D avatars by iteratively denoising 2D renders of the predicted 3D representation. Furthermore we introduce a generator neural network that approximates rendering with considerably reduced runtime (55x speed up) resulting in a novel dual-branch diffusion framework. Our experiments show that DiffHuman can produce diverse and detailed reconstructions for the parts of the person that are unseen or uncertain in the input image while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art when reconstructing visible surfaces.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sengupta_DiffHuman_Probabilistic_Photorealistic_3D_Reconstruction_of_Humans_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Permutation Equivariance of Transformers and Its Applications,"Xu, Hengyuan, Xiang, Liyao, Ye, Hangyu, Yao, Dixi, Chu, Pengzhi, Li, Baochun",Revolutionizing the field of deep learning Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in many tasks. Recent research has recognized these models are robust to shuffling but are limited to inter-token permutation in the forward propagation. In this work we propose our definition of permutation equivariance a broader concept covering both inter- and intra- token permutation in the forward and backward propagation of neural networks. We rigorously proved that such permutation equivariance property can be satisfied on most vanilla Transformer-based models with almost no adaptation. We examine the property over a range of state-of-the-art models including ViT Bert GPT and others with experimental validations. Further as a proof-of-concept we explore how real-world applications including privacy-enhancing split learning and model authorization could exploit the permutation equivariance property which implicates wider intriguing application scenarios.

SVDTree: Semantic Voxel Diffusion for Single Image Tree Reconstruction,"Li, Yuan, Liu, Zhihao, Benes, Bedrich, Zhang, Xiaopeng, Guo, Jianwei",Efficiently representing and reconstructing the 3D geometry of biological trees remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. We propose a novel approach for generating realistic tree models from single-view photographs. We cast the 3D information inference problem to a semantic voxel diffusion process which converts an input image of a tree to a novel Semantic Voxel Structure (SVS) in 3D space. The SVS encodes the geometric appearance and semantic structural information (e.g. classifying trunks branches and leaves) which retains the intricate internal tree features. Tailored to the SVS we present SVDTree a new hybrid tree modeling approach by combining structure-oriented branch reconstruction and self-organization-based foliage reconstruction. We validate SVDTree by using images from both synthetic and real trees. The comparison results show that our approach can better preserve tree details and achieve more realistic and accurate reconstruction results than previous methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_SVDTree_Semantic_Voxel_Diffusion_for_Single_Image_Tree_Reconstruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Rethinking FID: Towards a Better Evaluation Metric for Image Generation,"Jayasumana, Sadeep, Ramalingam, Srikumar, Veit, Andreas, Glasner, Daniel, Chakrabarti, Ayan, Kumar, Sanjiv",As with many machine learning problems the progress of image generation methods hinges on good evaluation metrics. One of the most popular is the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). FID estimates the distance between a distribution of Inception-v3 features of real images and those of images generated by the algorithm. We highlight important drawbacks of FID: Inception's poor representation of the rich and varied content generated by modern text-to-image models incorrect normality assumptions and poor sample complexity. We call for a reevaluation of FID's use as the primary quality metric for generated images. We empirically demonstrate that FID contradicts human raters it does not reflect gradual improvement of iterative text-to-image models it does not capture distortion levels and that it produces inconsistent results when varying the sample size. We also propose an alternative new metric CMMD based on richer CLIP embeddings and the maximum mean discrepancy distance with the Gaussian RBF kernel. It is an unbiased estimator that does not make any assumptions on the probability distribution of the embeddings and is sample efficient. Through extensive experiments and analysis we demonstrate that FID-based evaluations of text-to-image models may be unreliable and that CMMD offers a more robust and reliable assessment of image quality.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jayasumana_Rethinking_FID_Towards_a_Better_Evaluation_Metric_for_Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SuperPrimitive: Scene Reconstruction at a Primitive Level,"Mazur, Kirill, Bae, Gwangbin, Davison, Andrew J.",Joint camera pose and dense geometry estimation from a set of images or a monocular video remains a challenging problem due to its computational complexity and inherent visual ambiguities. Most dense incremental reconstruction systems operate directly on image pixels and solve for their 3D positions using multi-view geometry cues. Such pixel-level approaches suffer from ambiguities or violations of multi-view consistency (e.g. caused by textureless or specular surfaces). We address this issue with a new image representation which we call a SuperPrimitive. SuperPrimitives are obtained by splitting images into semantically correlated local regions and enhancing them with estimated surface normal directions both of which are predicted by state-of-the-art single image neural networks. This provides a local geometry estimate per SuperPrimitive while their relative positions are adjusted based on multi-view observations. We demonstrate the versatility of our new representation by addressing three 3D reconstruction tasks: depth completion few-view structure from motion and monocular dense visual odometry.

TFMQ-DM: Temporal Feature Maintenance Quantization for Diffusion Models,"Huang, Yushi, Gong, Ruihao, Liu, Jing, Chen, Tianlong, Liu, Xianglong",The Diffusion model a prevalent framework for image generation encounters significant challenges in terms of broad applicability due to its extended inference times and substantial memory requirements. Efficient Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is pivotal for addressing these issues in traditional models. Different from traditional models diffusion models heavily depend on the time-step t to achieve satisfactory multi-round denoising. Usually t from the finite set \ 1 \ldots T\  is encoded to a temporal feature by a few modules totally irrespective of the sampling data. However existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules separately. They adopt inappropriate reconstruction targets and complex calibration methods resulting in a severe disturbance of the temporal feature and denoising trajectory as well as a low compression efficiency. To solve these we propose a Temporal Feature Maintenance Quantization (TFMQ) framework building upon a Temporal Information Block which is just related to the time-step t and unrelated to the sampling data. Powered by the pioneering block design we devise temporal information aware reconstruction (TIAR) and finite set calibration (FSC) to align the full-precision temporal features in a limited time. Equipped with the framework we can maintain the most temporal information and ensure the end-to-end generation quality. Extensive experiments on various datasets and diffusion models prove our state-of-the-art results. Remarkably our quantization approach for the first time achieves model performance nearly on par with the full-precision model under 4-bit weight quantization. Additionally our method incurs almost no extra computational cost and accelerates quantization time by 2.0 xon LSUN-Bedrooms 256 x256 compared to previous works.

CONFORM: Contrast is All You Need for High-Fidelity Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Meral, Tuna Han Salih, Simsar, Enis, Tombari, Federico, Yanardag, Pinar",Images produced by text-to-image diffusion models might not always faithfully represent the semantic intent of the provided text prompt where the model might overlook or entirely fail to produce certain objects. While recent studies propose various solutions they often require customly tailored functions for each of these problems leading to sub-optimal results especially for complex prompts. Our work introduces a novel perspective by tackling this challenge in a contrastive context. Our approach intuitively promotes the segregation of objects in attention maps while also maintaining that pairs of related attributes are kept close to each other. We conducted extensive experiments across a wide variety of scenarios each involving unique combinations of objects attributes and scenes. These experiments effectively showcase the versatility efficiency and flexibility of our method in working with both latent and pixel-based diffusion models including Stable Diffusion and Imagen. Moreover we publicly share our source code to facilitate further research.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Meral_CONFORM_Contrast_is_All_You_Need_for_High-Fidelity_Text-to-Image_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Self-Supervised Facial Representation Learning with Facial Region Awareness,"Gao, Zheng, Patras, Ioannis",Self-supervised pre-training has been proved to be effective in learning transferable representations that benefit various visual tasks. This paper asks this question: can self-supervised pre-training learn general facial representations for various facial analysis tasks? Recent efforts toward this goal are limited to treating each face image as a whole i.e. learning consistent facial representations at the image-level which overlooks the consistency of local facial representations (i.e. facial regions like eyes nose etc). In this work we make a first attempt to propose a novel self-supervised facial representation learning framework to learn consistent global and local facial representations Facial Region Awareness (FRA). Specifically we explicitly enforce the consistency of facial regions by matching the local facial representations across views which are extracted with learned heatmaps highlighting the facial regions. Inspired by the mask prediction in supervised semantic segmentation we obtain the heatmaps via cosine similarity between the per-pixel projection of feature maps and facial mask embeddings computed from learnable positional embeddings which leverage the attention mechanism to globally look up the facial image for facial regions. To learn such heatmaps we formulate the learning of facial mask embeddings as a deep clustering problem by assigning the pixel features from the feature maps to them. The transfer learning results on facial classification and regression tasks show that our FRA outperforms previous pre-trained models and more importantly using ResNet as the unified backbone for various tasks our FRA achieves comparable or even better performance compared with SOTA methods in facial analysis tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Gao_Self-Supervised_Facial_Representation_Learning_with_Facial_Region_Awareness_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
GaussianDreamer: Fast Generation from Text to 3D Gaussians by Bridging 2D and 3D Diffusion Models,"Yi, Taoran, Fang, Jiemin, Wang, Junjie, Wu, Guanjun, Xie, Lingxi, Zhang, Xiaopeng, Liu, Wenyu, Tian, Qi, Wang, Xinggang",In recent times the generation of 3D assets from text prompts has shown impressive results. Both 2D and 3D diffusion models can help generate decent 3D objects based on prompts. 3D diffusion models have good 3D consistency but their quality and generalization are limited as trainable 3D data is expensive and hard to obtain. 2D diffusion models enjoy strong abilities of generalization and fine generation but 3D consistency is hard to guarantee. This paper attempts to bridge the power from the two types of diffusion models via the recent explicit and efficient 3D Gaussian splatting representation. A fast 3D object generation framework named as GaussianDreamer is proposed where the 3D diffusion model provides priors for initialization and the 2D diffusion model enriches the geometry and appearance. Operations of noisy point growing and color perturbation are introduced to enhance the initialized Gaussians. Our GaussianDreamer can generate a high-quality 3D instance or 3D avatar within 15 minutes on one GPU much faster than previous methods while the generated instances can be directly rendered in real time.

Open-Vocabulary Attention Maps with Token Optimization for Semantic Segmentation in Diffusion Models,"Marcos-Manch√≥n, Pablo, Alcover-Couso, Roberto, SanMiguel, Juan C., Mart√≠nez, Jos√© M.",Diffusion models represent a new paradigm in text-to-image generation. Beyond generating high-quality images from text prompts models such as Stable Diffusion have been successfully extended to the joint generation of semantic segmentation pseudo-masks. However current extensions primarily rely on extracting attentions linked to prompt words used for image synthesis. This approach limits the generation of segmentation masks derived from word tokens not contained in the text prompt. In this work we introduce Open-Vocabulary Attention Maps (OVAM)--a training-free method for text-to-image diffusion models that enables the generation of attention maps for any word. In addition we propose a lightweight optimization process based on OVAM for finding tokens that generate accurate attention maps for an object class with a single annotation. We evaluate these tokens within existing state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion extensions. The best-performing model improves its mIoU from 52.1 to 86.6 for the synthetic images' pseudo-masks demonstrating that our optimized tokens are an efficient way to improve the performance of existing methods without architectural changes or retraining.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Marcos-Manchon_Open-Vocabulary_Attention_Maps_with_Token_Optimization_for_Semantic_Segmentation_in_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DreamComposer: Controllable 3D Object Generation via Multi-View Conditions,"Yang, Yunhan, Huang, Yukun, Wu, Xiaoyang, Guo, Yuan-Chen, Zhang, Song-Hai, Zhao, Hengshuang, He, Tong, Liu, Xihui",Utilizing pre-trained 2D large-scale generative models recent works are capable of generating high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image. However due to the lack of information from multiple views these works encounter difficulties in generating controllable novel views. In this paper we present DreamComposer a flexible and scalable framework that can enhance existing view-aware diffusion models by injecting multi-view conditions. Specifically DreamComposer first uses a view-aware 3D lifting module to obtain 3D representations of an object from multiple views. Then it renders the latent features of the target view from 3D representations with the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally the target view features extracted from multi-view inputs are injected into a pre-trained diffusion model. Experiments show that DreamComposer is compatible with state-of-the-art diffusion models for zero-shot novel view synthesis further enhancing them to generate high-fidelity novel view images with multi-view conditions ready for controllable 3D object reconstruction and various other applications.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yang_DreamComposer_Controllable_3D_Object_Generation_via_Multi-View_Conditions_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Self-Calibrating Vicinal Risk Minimisation for Model Calibration,"Liu, Jiawei, Ye, Changkun, Cui, Ruikai, Barnes, Nick",Model calibration measuring the alignment between the prediction accuracy and model confidence is an important metric reflecting model trustworthiness. Existing dense binary classification methods without proper regularisation of model confidence are prone to being over-confident. To calibrate Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) we propose a Self-Calibrating Vicinal Risk Minimisation (SCVRM) that explores the vicinity space of labeled data where vicinal images that are farther away from labeled images adopt the groundtruth label with decreasing label confidence. We prove that in the logistic regression problem SCVRM can be seen as a Vicinal Risk Minimisation plus a regularisation term that penalises the over-confident predictions. In practical implementation SCVRM is approximated using Monte Carlo sampling that samples additional augmented training images and labels from the vicinal distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that SCVRM can significantly enhance model calibration for different dense classification tasks on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Code is available at https://github.com/Carlisle-Liu/SCVRM.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Self-Calibrating_Vicinal_Risk_Minimisation_for_Model_Calibration_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
LPSNet: End-to-End Human Pose and Shape Estimation with Lensless Imaging,"Ge, Haoyang, Feng, Qiao, Jia, Hailong, Li, Xiongzheng, Yin, Xiangjun, Zhou, You, Yang, Jingyu, Li, Kun",Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation with lensless imaging is not only beneficial to privacy protection but also can be used in covert surveillance scenarios due to the small size and simple structure of this device. However this task presents significant challenges due to the inherent ambiguity of the captured measurements and lacks effective methods for directly estimating human pose and shape from lensless data. In this paper we propose the first end-to-end framework to recover 3D human poses and shapes from lensless measurements to our knowledge. We specifically design a multi-scale lensless feature decoder to decode the lensless measurements through the optically encoded mask for efficient feature extraction. We also propose a double-head auxiliary supervision mechanism to improve the estimation accuracy of human limb ends.

Towards a Simultaneous and Granular Identity-Expression Control in Personalized Face Generation,"Liu, Renshuai, Ma, Bowen, Zhang, Wei, Hu, Zhipeng, Fan, Changjie, Lv, Tangjie, Ding, Yu, Cheng, Xuan",In human-centric content generation the pre-trained text-to-image models struggle to produce user-wanted portrait images which retain the identity of individuals while exhibiting diverse expressions. This paper introduces our efforts towards personalized face generation. To this end we propose a novel multi-modal face generation framework capable of simultaneous identity-expression control and more fine-grained expression synthesis. Our expression control is so sophisticated that it can be specialized by the fine-grained emotional vocabulary. We devise a novel diffusion model that can undertake the task of simultaneously face swapping and reenactment. Due to the entanglement of identity and expression separately and precisely controlling them within one framework is a nontrivial task thus has not been explored yet. To overcome this we propose several innovative designs in the conditional diffusion model including balancing identity and expression encoder improved midpoint sampling and explicitly background conditioning. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the controllability and scalability of the proposed framework in comparison with state-of-the-art text-to-image face swapping and face reenactment methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Towards_a_Simultaneous_and_Granular_Identity-Expression_Control_in_Personalized_Face_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PEEKABOO: Interactive Video Generation via Masked-Diffusion,"Jain, Yash, Nasery, Anshul, Vineet, Vibhav, Behl, Harkirat",Modern video generation models like Sora have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality videos. However a significant limitation is their inability to offer interactive control to users a feature that promises to open up unprecedented applications and creativity. In this work we introduce the first solution to equip diffusion-based video generation models with spatio-temporal control. We present Peekaboo a novel masked attention module which seamlessly integrates with current video generation models offering control without the need for additional training or inference overhead. To facilitate future research we also introduce a comprehensive benchmark for interactive video generation. This benchmark offers a standardized framework for the community to assess the efficacy of emerging interactive video generation models. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative assessments reveal that Peekaboo achieves up to a 3.8x improvement in mIoU over baseline models all while maintaining the same latency. Code and benchmark are available on the webpage.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jain_PEEKABOO_Interactive_Video_Generation_via_Masked-Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
High-fidelity Person-centric Subject-to-Image Synthesis,"Wang, Yibin, Zhang, Weizhong, Zheng, Jianwei, Jin, Cheng",Current subject-driven image generation methods encounter significant challenges in person-centric image generation. The reason is that they learn the semantic scene and person generation by fine-tuning a common pre-trained diffusion which involves an irreconcilable training imbalance. Precisely to generate realistic persons they need to sufficiently tune the pre-trained model which inevitably causes the model to forget the rich semantic scene prior and makes scene generation over-fit to the training data. Moreover even with sufficient fine-tuning these methods can still not generate high-fidelity persons since joint learning of the scene and person generation also lead to quality compromise. In this paper we propose Face-diffuser an effective collaborative generation pipeline to eliminate the above training imbalance and quality compromise. Specifically we first develop two specialized pre-trained diffusion models i.e. Text-driven Diffusion Model (TDM) and Subject-augmented Diffusion Model (SDM) for scene and person generation respectively. The sampling process is divided into three sequential stages i.e. semantic scene construction subject-scene fusion and subject enhancement. The first and last stages are performed by TDM and SDM respectively. The subject-scene fusion stage that is the collaboration achieved through a novel and highly effective mechanism Saliency-adaptive Noise Fusion (SNF). Specifically it is based on our key observation that there exists a robust link between classifier-free guidance responses and the saliency of generated images. In each time step SNF leverages the unique strengths of each model and allows for the spatial blending of predicted noises from both models automatically in a saliency-aware manner all of which can be seamlessly integrated into the DDIM sampling process. Extensive experiments confirm the impressive effectiveness and robustness of the Face-diffuser in generating high-fidelity person images depicting multiple unseen persons with varying contexts.

JeDi: Joint-Image Diffusion Models for Finetuning-Free Personalized Text-to-Image Generation,"Zeng, Yu, Patel, Vishal M., Wang, Haochen, Huang, Xun, Wang, Ting-Chun, Liu, Ming-Yu, Balaji, Yogesh",Personalized text-to-image generation models enable users to create images that depict their individual possessions in diverse scenes finding applications in various domains. To achieve the personalization capability existing methods rely on finetuning a text-to-image foundation model on a user's custom dataset which can be non-trivial for general users resource-intensive and time-consuming. Despite attempts to develope finetuning-free methods their generation quality is much lower compared to their finetuning counterparts. In this paper we propose Joint-Image Diffusion (\jedi) an effective technique for learning a finetuning-free personalization model. Our key idea is to learn the joint distribution of multiple related text-image pairs that share a common subject. To facilitate learning we propose a scalable synthetic dataset generation technique. Once trained our model enables fast and easy personalization at test time by simply using reference images as input during the sampling process. Our approach does not require any expensive optimization process or additional modules and can faithfully preserve the identity represented by any number of reference images. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art generation quality both quantitatively and qualitatively significantly outperforming both the prior finetuning-based and finetuning-free personalization baselines.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zeng_JeDi_Joint-Image_Diffusion_Models_for_Finetuning-Free_Personalized_Text-to-Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HandDiff: 3D Hand Pose Estimation with Diffusion on Image-Point Cloud,"Cheng, Wencan, Tang, Hao, Van Gool, Luc, Ko, Jong Hwan",Extracting keypoint locations from input hand frames known as 3D hand pose estimation is a critical task in various human-computer interaction applications. Essentially the 3D hand pose estimation can be regarded as a 3D point subset generative problem conditioned on input frames. Thanks to the recent significant progress on diffusion-based generative models hand pose estimation can also benefit from the diffusion model to estimate keypoint locations with high quality. However directly deploying the existing diffusion models to solve hand pose estimation is non-trivial since they cannot achieve the complex permutation mapping and precise localization. Based on this motivation this paper proposes HandDiff a diffusion-based hand pose estimation model that iteratively denoises accurate hand pose conditioned on hand-shaped image-point clouds. In order to recover keypoint permutation and accurate location we further introduce joint-wise condition and local detail condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HandDiff significantly outperforms the existing approaches on four challenging hand pose benchmark datasets. Codes and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/cwc1260/HandDiff.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cheng_HandDiff_3D_Hand_Pose_Estimation_with_Diffusion_on_Image-Point_Cloud_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
VP3D: Unleashing 2D Visual Prompt for Text-to-3D Generation,"Chen, Yang, Pan, Yingwei, Yang, Haibo, Yao, Ting, Mei, Tao",Recent innovations on text-to-3D generation have featured Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) which enables the zero-shot learning of implicit 3D models (NeRF) by directly distilling prior knowledge from 2D diffusion models. However current SDS-based models still struggle with intricate text prompts and commonly result in distorted 3D models with unrealistic textures or cross-view inconsistency issues. In this work we introduce a novel Visual Prompt-guided text-to-3D diffusion model (VP3D) that explicitly unleashes the visual appearance knowledge in 2D visual prompt to boost text-to-3D generation. Instead of solely supervising SDS with text prompt VP3D first capitalizes on 2D diffusion model to generate a high-quality image from input text which subsequently acts as visual prompt to strengthen SDS optimization with explicit visual appearance. Meanwhile we couple the SDS optimization with additional differentiable reward function that encourages rendering images of 3D models to better visually align with 2D visual prompt and semantically match with text prompt. Through extensive experiments we show that the 2D Visual Prompt in our VP3D significantly eases the learning of visual appearance of 3D models and thus leads to higher visual fidelity with more detailed textures. It is also appealing in view that when replacing the self-generating visual prompt with a given reference image VP3D is able to trigger a new task of stylized text-to-3D generation.

Content-Style Decoupling for Unsupervised Makeup Transfer without Generating Pseudo Ground Truth,"Sun, Zhaoyang, Xiong, Shengwu, Chen, Yaxiong, Rong, Yi",The absence of real targets to guide the model training is one of the main problems with the makeup transfer task. Most existing methods tackle this problem by synthesizing pseudo ground truths (PGTs). However the generated PGTs are often sub-optimal and their imprecision will eventually lead to performance degradation. To alleviate this issue in this paper we propose a novel Content-Style Decoupled Makeup Transfer (CSD-MT) method which works in a purely unsupervised manner and thus eliminates the negative effects of generating PGTs. Specifically based on the frequency characteristics analysis we assume that the low-frequency (LF) component of a face image is more associated with its makeup style information while the high-frequency (HF) component is more related to its content details. This assumption allows CSD-MT to decouple the content and makeup style information in each face image through the frequency decomposition. After that CSD-MT realizes makeup transfer by maximizing the consistency of these two types of information between the transferred result and input images respectively. Two newly designed loss functions are also introduced to further improve the transfer performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses show the effectiveness of our CSD-MT method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Snowfallingplum/CSD-MT.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sun_Content-Style_Decoupling_for_Unsupervised_Makeup_Transfer_without_Generating_Pseudo_Ground_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
You Only Need Less Attention at Each Stage in Vision Transformers,"Zhang, Shuoxi, Liu, Hanpeng, Lin, Stephen, He, Kun",The advent of Vision Transformers (ViTs) marks a substantial paradigm shift in the realm of computer vision. ViTs capture the global information of images through self-attention modules which perform dot product computations among patchified image tokens. While self-attention modules empower ViTs to capture long-range dependencies the computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tokens which is a major hindrance to the practical application of ViTs. Moreover the self-attention mechanism in deep ViTs is also susceptible to the attention saturation issue. Accordingly we argue against the necessity of computing the attention scores in every layer and we propose the Less-Attention Vision Transformer (LaViT) which computes only a few attention operations at each stage and calculates the subsequent feature alignments in other layers via attention transformations that leverage the previously calculated attention scores. This novel approach can mitigate two primary issues plaguing traditional self-attention modules: the heavy computational burden and attention saturation. Our proposed architecture offers superior efficiency and ease of implementation merely requiring matrix multiplications that are highly optimized in contemporary deep learning frameworks. Moreover our architecture demonstrates exceptional performance across various vision tasks including classification detection and segmentation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_You_Only_Need_Less_Attention_at_Each_Stage_in_Vision_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Generalizable Novel-View Synthesis using a Stereo Camera,"Lee, Haechan, Jin, Wonjoon, Baek, Seung-Hwan, Cho, Sunghyun",In this paper we propose the first generalizable view synthesis approach that specifically targets multi-view stereo-camera images. Since recent stereo matching has demonstrated accurate geometry prediction we introduce stereo matching into novel-view synthesis for high-quality geometry reconstruction. To this end this paper proposes a novel framework dubbed StereoNeRF which integrates stereo matching into a NeRF-based generalizable view synthesis approach. StereoNeRF is equipped with three key components to effectively exploit stereo matching in novel-view synthesis: a stereo feature extractor a depth-guided plane-sweeping and a stereo depth loss. Moreover we propose the StereoNVS dataset the first multi-view dataset of stereo-camera images encompassing a wide variety of both real and synthetic scenes. Our experimental results demonstrate that StereoNeRF surpasses previous approaches in generalizable view synthesis.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_Generalizable_Novel-View_Synthesis_using_a_Stereo_Camera_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Our framework comprises two primary components: 1) SocioMind: a meticulously crafted digital brain that models personalities with systematic few-shot exemplars incorporates a reflection process based on psychology principles and emulates autonomy by initiating dialogue topics; 2) MoMat-MoGen: a text-driven motion synthesis paradigm for controlling the character's digital body. It integrates motion matching a proven industry technique to ensure motion quality with cutting-edge advancements in motion generation for diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that each module achieves state-of-the-art performance in its respective domain. Collectively they enable virtual characters to initiate and sustain dialogues autonomously while evolving their socio-psychological states. Concurrently these characters can perform contextually relevant bodily movements. Additionally an extension of DLP enables a virtual character to recognize and appropriately respond to human players' actions.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cai_Digital_Life_Project_Autonomous_3D_Characters_with_Social_Intelligence_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Rethinking Prior Information Generation with CLIP for Few-Shot Segmentation,"Wang, Jin, Zhang, Bingfeng, Pang, Jian, Chen, Honglong, Liu, Weifeng",Few-shot segmentation remains challenging due to the limitations of its labeling information for unseen classes. Most previous approaches rely on extracting high-level feature maps from the frozen visual encoder to compute the pixel-wise similarity as a key prior guidance for the decoder. However such a prior representation suffers from coarse granularity and poor generalization to new classes since these high-level feature maps have obvious category bias. In this work we propose to replace the visual prior representation with the visual-text alignment capacity to capture more reliable guidance and enhance the model generalization. Specifically we design two kinds of training-free prior information generation strategy that attempts to utilize the semantic alignment capability of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) to locate the target class. Besides to acquire more accurate prior guidance we build a high-order relationship of attention maps and utilize it to refine the initial prior information. Experiments on both the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets show that our method obtains a clearly substantial improvement and reaches the new state-of-the-art performance. The code is available on the project website.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Rethinking_Prior_Information_Generation_with_CLIP_for_Few-Shot_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Generative Rendering: Controllable 4D-Guided Video Generation with 2D Diffusion Models,"Cai, Shengqu, Ceylan, Duygu, Gadelha, Matheus, Huang, Chun-Hao Paul, Wang, Tuanfeng Yang, Wetzstein, Gordon",Traditional 3D content creation tools empower users to bring their imagination to life by giving them direct control over a scene's geometry appearance motion and camera path. Creating computer-generated videos however is a tedious manual process which can be automated by emerging text-to-video diffusion models. Despite great promise video diffusion models are difficult to control hindering users to apply their creativity rather than amplifying it. To address this challenge we present a novel approach that combines the controllability of dynamic 3D meshes with the expressivity and editability of emerging diffusion models. For this purpose our approach takes an animated low-fidelity rendered mesh as input and injects the ground truth correspondence information obtained from the dynamic mesh into various stages of a pre-trained text-to-image generation model to output high-quality and temporally consistent frames. We demonstrate our approach on various examples where motion can be obtained by animating rigged assets or changing the camera path.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cai_Generative_Rendering_Controllable_4D-Guided_Video_Generation_with_2D_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Relightable Gaussian Codec Avatars,"Saito, Shunsuke, Schwartz, Gabriel, Simon, Tomas, Li, Junxuan, Nam, Giljoo",The fidelity of relighting is bounded by both geometry and appearance representations. For geometry both mesh and volumetric approaches have difficulty modeling intricate structures like 3D hair geometry. For appearance existing relighting models are limited in fidelity and often too slow to render in real-time with high-resolution continuous environments. In this work we present Relightable Gaussian Codec Avatars a method to build high-fidelity relightable head avatars that can be animated to generate novel expressions. Our geometry model based on 3D Gaussians can capture 3D-consistent sub-millimeter details such as hair strands and pores on dynamic face sequences. To support diverse materials of human heads such as the eyes skin and hair in a unified manner we present a novel relightable appearance model based on learnable radiance transfer. Together with global illumination-aware spherical harmonics for the diffuse components we achieve real-time relighting with all-frequency reflections using spherical Gaussians. This appearance model can be efficiently relit under both point light and continuous illumination. We further improve the fidelity of eye reflections and enable explicit gaze control by introducing relightable explicit eye models. Our method outperforms existing approaches without compromising real-time performance. We also demonstrate real-time relighting of avatars on a tethered consumer VR headset showcasing the efficiency and fidelity of our avatars.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Saito_Relightable_Gaussian_Codec_Avatars_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Single-to-Dual-View Adaptation for Egocentric 3D Hand Pose Estimation,"Liu, Ruicong, Ohkawa, Takehiko, Zhang, Mingfang, Sato, Yoichi",The pursuit of accurate 3D hand pose estimation stands as a keystone for understanding human activity in the realm of egocentric vision. The majority of existing estimation methods still rely on single-view images as input leading to potential limitations e.g. limited field-of-view and ambiguity in depth. To address these problems adding another camera to better capture the shape of hands is a practical direction. However existing multi-view hand pose estimation methods suffer from two main drawbacks: 1) Requiring multi-view annotations for training which are expensive. 2) During testing the model becomes inapplicable if camera parameters/layout are not the same as those used in training. In this paper we propose a novel Single-to-Dual-view adaptation (S2DHand) solution that adapts a pre-trained single-view estimator to dual views. Compared with existing multi-view training methods 1) our adaptation process is unsupervised eliminating the need for multi-view annotation. 2) Moreover our method can handle arbitrary dual-view pairs with unknown camera parameters making the model applicable to diverse camera settings. Specifically S2DHand is built on certain stereo constraints including pair-wise cross-view consensus and invariance of transformation between both views. These two stereo constraints are used in a complementary manner to generate pseudo-labels allowing reliable adaptation. Evaluation results reveal that S2DHand achieves significant improvements on arbitrary camera pairs under both in-dataset and cross-dataset settings and outperforms existing adaptation methods with leading performance.

Animate Anyone: Consistent and Controllable Image-to-Video Synthesis for Character Animation,"Hu, Li",Character Animation aims to generating character videos from still images through driving signals. Currently diffusion models have become the mainstream in visual generation research owing to their robust generative capabilities. However challenges persist in the realm of image-to-video especially in character animation where temporally maintaining consistency with detailed information from character remains a formidable problem. In this paper we leverage the power of diffusion models and propose a novel framework tailored for character animation. To preserve consistency of intricate appearance features from reference image we design ReferenceNet to merge detail features via spatial attention. To ensure controllability and continuity we introduce an efficient pose guider to direct character's movements and employ an effective temporal modeling approach to ensure smooth inter-frame transitions between video frames. By expanding the training data our approach can animate arbitrary characters yielding superior results in character animation compared to other image-to-video methods. Furthermore we evaluate our method on image animation benchmarks achieving state-of-the-art results.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hu_Animate_Anyone_Consistent_and_Controllable_Image-to-Video_Synthesis_for_Character_Animation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FreeCustom: Tuning-Free Customized Image Generation for Multi-Concept Composition,"Ding, Ganggui, Zhao, Canyu, Wang, Wen, Yang, Zhen, Liu, Zide, Chen, Hao, Shen, Chunhua",Benefiting from large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative models impressive progress has been achieved in customized image generation which aims to generate user-specified concepts. Existing approaches have extensively focused on single-concept customization and still encounter challenges when it comes to complex scenarios that involve combining multiple concepts. These approaches often require retraining/fine-tuning using a few images leading to time-consuming training processes and impeding their swift implementation. Furthermore the reliance on multiple images to represent a singular concept increases the difficulty of customization. To this end we propose FreeCustom a novel tuning-free method to generate customized images of multi-concept composition based on reference concepts using only one image per concept as input. Specifically we introduce a new multi-reference self-attention (MRSA) mechanism and a weighted mask strategy that enables the generated image to access and focus more on the reference concepts. In addition MRSA leverages our key finding that input concepts are better preserved when providing images with context interactions. Experiments show that our method's produced images are consistent with the given concepts and better aligned with the input text. Our method outperforms or performs on par with other training-based methods in terms of multi-concept composition and single-concept customization but is simpler.

MaskINT: Video Editing via Interpolative Non-autoregressive Masked Transformers,"Ma, Haoyu, Mahdizadehaghdam, Shahin, Wu, Bichen, Fan, Zhipeng, Gu, Yuchao, Zhao, Wenliang, Shapira, Lior, Xie, Xiaohui",Recent advances in generative AI have significantly enhanced image and video editing particularly in the context of text prompt control. State-of-the-art approaches predominantly rely on diffusion models to accomplish these tasks. However the computational demands of diffusion-based methods are substantial often necessitating large-scale paired datasets for training and therefore challenging the deployment in real applications. To address these issues this paper breaks down the text-based video editing task into two stages. First we leverage an pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to simultaneously edit few keyframes in an zero-shot way. Second we introduce an efficient model called MaskINT which is built on non-autoregressive masked generative transformers and specializes in frame interpolation between the edited keyframes using the structural guidance from intermediate frames. Experimental results suggest that our MaskINT achieves comparable performance with diffusion-based methodologies while significantly improve the inference time. This research offers a practical solution for text-based video editing and showcases the potential of non-autoregressive masked generative transformers in this domain.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ma_MaskINT_Video_Editing_via_Interpolative_Non-autoregressive_Masked_Transformers_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Learning Multi-Dimensional Human Preference for Text-to-Image Generation,"Zhang, Sixian, Wang, Bohan, Wu, Junqiang, Li, Yan, Gao, Tingting, Zhang, Di, Wang, Zhongyuan",Current metrics for text-to-image models typically rely on statistical metrics which inadequately represent the real preference of humans. Although recent work attempts to learn these preferences via human annotated images they reduce the rich tapestry of human preference to a single overall score. However the preference results vary when humans evaluate images with different aspects. Therefore to learn the multi-dimensional human preferences we propose the Multi-dimensional Preference Score (MPS) the first multi-dimensional preference scoring model for the evaluation of text-to-image models. The MPS introduces the preference condition module upon CLIP model to learn these diverse preferences. It is trained based on our Multi-dimensional Human Preference (MHP) Dataset which comprises 918315 human preference choices across four dimensions (i.e. aesthetics semantic alignment detail quality and overall assessment) on 607541 images. The images are generated by a wide range of latest text-to-image models. The MPS outperforms existing scoring methods across 3 datasets in 4 dimensions enabling it a promising metric for evaluating and improving text-to-image generation. The model and dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate future research.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Learning_Multi-Dimensional_Human_Preference_for_Text-to-Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ViVid-1-to-3: Novel View Synthesis with Video Diffusion Models,"Kwak, Jeong-gi, Dong, Erqun, Jin, Yuhe, Ko, Hanseok, Mahajan, Shweta, Yi, Kwang Moo",Generating novel views of an object from a single image is a challenging task. It requires an understanding of the underlying 3D structure of the object from an image and rendering high-quality spatially consistent new views. While recent methods for view synthesis based on diffusion have shown great progress achieving consistency among various view estimates and at the same time abiding by the desired camera pose remains a critical problem yet to be solved. In this work we demonstrate a strikingly simple method where we utilize a pre-trained video diffusion model to solve this problem. Our key idea is that synthesizing a novel view could be reformulated as synthesizing a video of a camera going around the object of interest---a scanning video---which then allows us to leverage the powerful priors that a video diffusion model would have learned. Thus to perform novel-view synthesis we create a smooth camera trajectory to the target view that we wish to render and denoise using both a view-conditioned diffusion model and a video diffusion model. By doing so we obtain a highly consistent novel view synthesis outperforming the state of the art.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kwak_ViVid-1-to-3_Novel_View_Synthesis_with_Video_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Generating Human Motion in 3D Scenes from Text Descriptions,"Cen, Zhi, Pi, Huaijin, Peng, Sida, Shen, Zehong, Yang, Minghui, Zhu, Shuai, Bao, Hujun, Zhou, Xiaowei",Generating human motions from textual descriptions has gained growing research interest due to its wide range of applications. However only a few works consider human-scene interactions together with text conditions which is crucial for visual and physical realism. This paper focuses on the task of generating human motions in 3D indoor scenes given text descriptions of the human-scene interactions. This task presents challenges due to the multimodality nature of text scene and motion as well as the need for spatial reasoning. To address these challenges we propose a new approach that decomposes the complex problem into two more manageable sub-problems: (1) language grounding of the target object and (2) object-centric motion generation. For language grounding of the target object we leverage the power of large language models. For motion generation we design an object-centric scene representation for the generative model to focus on the target object thereby reducing the scene complexity and facilitating the modeling of the relationship between human motions and the object. Experiments demonstrate the better motion quality of our approach compared to baselines and validate our design choices.

QDFormer: Towards Robust Audiovisual Segmentation in Complex Environments with Quantization-based Semantic Decomposition,"Li, Xiang, Wang, Jinglu, Xu, Xiaohao, Peng, Xiulian, Singh, Rita, Lu, Yan, Raj, Bhiksha",Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) is a challenging task that aims to segment visual objects in videos according to their associated acoustic cues. With multiple sound sources and background disturbances involved establishing robust correspondences between audio and visual contents poses unique challenges due to (1) complex entanglement across sound sources and (2) frequent changes in the occurrence of distinct sound events. Assuming sound events occur independently the multi-source semantic space can be represented as the Cartesian product of single-source sub-spaces. We are motivated to decompose the multi-source audio semantics into single-source semantics for more effective interactions with visual content. We propose a semantic decomposition method based on product quantization where the multi-source semantics can be decomposed and represented by several disentangled and noise-suppressed single-source semantics. Furthermore we introduce a global-to-local quantization mechanism which distills knowledge from stable global (clip-level) features into local (frame-level) ones to handle frequent changes in audio semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our semantically decomposed audio representation significantly improves AVS performance eg +21.2% mIoU on the challenging AVS-Semantic benchmark with ResNet50 backbone.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_QDFormer_Towards_Robust_Audiovisual_Segmentation_in_Complex_Environments_with_Quantization-based_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Fast Adaptation for Human Pose Estimation via Meta-Optimization,"Hu, Shengxiang, Sun, Huaijiang, Li, Bin, Wei, Dong, Li, Weiqing, Lu, Jianfeng",Domain shift is a challenge for supervised human pose estimation where the source data and target data come from different distributions. This is why pose estimation methods generally perform worse on the test set than on the training set. Recently test-time adaptation has proven to be an effective way to deal with domain shift in human pose estimation. Although the performance on the target domain has been improved existing methods require a large number of weight updates for convergence which is time-consuming and brings catastrophic forgetting. To solve these issues we propose a meta-auxiliary learning method to achieve fast adaptation for domain shift during inference. Specifically we take human pose estimation as the supervised primary task and propose body-specific image inpainting as a self-supervised auxiliary task. First we jointly train the primary and auxiliary tasks to get a pre-trained model on the source domain. Then meta-training correlates the performance of the two tasks to learn a good weight initialization. Finally meta-testing adapts the meta-learned model to the target data through self-supervised learning. Benefiting from the meta-learning paradigm the proposed method enables fast adaptation to the target domain while preserving the source domain knowledge. The carefully designed auxiliary task better pays attention to human-related semantics in a single image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our test-time fast adaptation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hu_Fast_Adaptation_for_Human_Pose_Estimation_via_Meta-Optimization_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
WOUAF: Weight Modulation for User Attribution and Fingerprinting in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Kim, Changhoon, Min, Kyle, Patel, Maitreya, Cheng, Sheng, Yang, Yezhou",The rapid advancement of generative models facilitating the creation of hyper-realistic images from textual descriptions has concurrently escalated critical societal concerns such as misinformation. Although providing some mitigation traditional fingerprinting mechanisms fall short in attributing responsibility for the malicious use of synthetic images. This paper introduces a novel approach to model fingerprinting that assigns responsibility for the generated images thereby serving as a potential countermeasure to model misuse. Our method modifies generative models based on each user's unique digital fingerprint imprinting a unique identifier onto the resultant content that can be traced back to the user. This approach incorporating fine-tuning into Text-to-Image (T2I) tasks using the Stable Diffusion Model demonstrates near-perfect attribution accuracy with a minimal impact on output quality. Through extensive evaluation we show that our method outperforms baseline methods with an average improvement of 11% in handling image post-processes. Our method presents a promising and novel avenue for accountable model distribution and responsible use.

Text-Conditioned Generative Model of 3D Strand-based Human Hairstyles,"Sklyarova, Vanessa, Zakharov, Egor, Hilliges, Otmar, Black, Michael J., Thies, Justus","We present HAAR a new strand-based generative model for 3D human hairstyles. Specifically based on textual inputs HAAR produces 3D hairstyles that could be used as production-level assets in modern computer graphics engines. Current AI-based generative models take advantage of powerful 2D priors to reconstruct 3D content in the form of point clouds meshes or volumetric functions. However by using the 2D priors they are intrinsically limited to only recovering the visual parts. Highly occluded hair structures can not be reconstructed with those methods and they only model the ""outer shell"" which is not ready to be used in physics-based rendering or simulation pipelines. In contrast we propose a first text-guided generative method that uses 3D hair strands as an underlying representation. Leveraging 2D visual question-answering (VQA) systems we automatically annotate synthetic hair models that are generated from a small set of artist-created hairstyles. This allows us to train a latent diffusion model that operates in a common hairstyle UV space. In qualitative and quantitative studies we demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model and compare it to existing hairstyle generation approaches.

Skeleton-in-Context: Unified Skeleton Sequence Modeling with In-Context Learning,"Wang, Xinshun, Fang, Zhongbin, Li, Xia, Li, Xiangtai, Chen, Chen, Liu, Mengyuan",In-context learning provides a new perspective for multi-task modeling for vision and NLP. Under this setting the model can perceive tasks from prompts and accomplish them without any extra task-specific head predictions or model fine-tuning. However skeleton sequence modeling via in-context learning remains unexplored. Directly applying existing in-context models from other areas onto skeleton sequences fails due to the similarity between inter-frame and cross-task poses which makes it exceptionally hard to perceive the task correctly from a subtle context. To address this challenge we propose Skeleton-in-Context (SiC) an effective framework for in-context skeleton sequence modeling. Our SiC is able to handle multiple skeleton-based tasks simultaneously after a single training process and accomplish each task from context according to the given prompt. It can further generalize to new unseen tasks according to customized prompts. To facilitate context perception we additionally propose a task-unified prompt which adaptively learns tasks of different natures such as partial joint-level generation sequence-level prediction or 2D-to-3D motion prediction. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our SiC on multiple tasks including motion prediction pose estimation joint completion and future pose estimation. We also evaluate its generalization capability on unseen tasks such as motion-in-between. These experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art multi-task performance and even outperforms single-task methods on certain tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Skeleton-in-Context_Unified_Skeleton_Sequence_Modeling_with_In-Context_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DemoFusion: Democratising High-Resolution Image Generation With No $$$,"Du, Ruoyi, Chang, Dongliang, Hospedales, Timothy, Song, Yi-Zhe, Ma, Zhanyu","High-resolution image generation with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has immense potential but due to the enormous capital investment required for training it is increasingly centralised to a few large corporations and hidden behind paywalls. This paper aims to democratise high-resolution GenAI by advancing the frontier of high-resolution generation while remaining accessible to a broad audience. We demonstrate that existing Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) possess untapped potential for higher-resolution image generation. Our novel DemoFusion framework seamlessly extends open-source GenAI models employing Progressive Upscaling Skip Residual and Dilated Sampling mechanisms to achieve higher-resolution image generation. The progressive nature of DemoFusion requires more passes but the intermediate results can serve as ""previews"" facilitating rapid prompt iteration.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Du_DemoFusion_Democratising_High-Resolution_Image_Generation_With_No__CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Total Selfie: Generating Full-Body Selfies,"Chen, Bowei, Curless, Brian, Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, Ira, Seitz, Steven M.",We present a method to generate full-body selfies from photographs originally taken at arms length. Because self-captured photos are typically taken close up they have limited field of view and exaggerated perspective that distorts facial shapes. We instead seek to generate the photo some one else would take of you from a few feet away. Our approach takes as input four selfies of your face and body a background image and generates a full-body selfie in a desired target pose. We introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to combine all of this information into high-quality well-composed photos of you with the desired pose and background.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Total_Selfie_Generating_Full-Body_Selfies_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Learning Structure-from-Motion with Graph Attention Networks,"Brynte, Lucas, Iglesias, Jos√© Pedro, Olsson, Carl, Kahl, Fredrik",In this paper we tackle the problem of learning Structure-from-Motion (SfM) through the use of graph attention networks. SfM is a classic computer vision problem that is solved though iterative minimization of reprojection errors referred to as Bundle Adjustment (BA) starting from a good initialization. In order to obtain a good enough initialization to BA conventional methods rely on a sequence of sub-problems (such as pairwise pose estimation pose averaging or triangulation) which provide an initial solution that can then be refined using BA. In this work we replace these sub-problems by learning a model that takes as input the 2D keypoints detected across multiple views and outputs the corresponding camera poses and 3D keypoint coordinates. Our model takes advantage of graph neural networks to learn SfM-specific primitives and we show that it can be used for fast inference of the reconstruction for new and unseen sequences. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms competing learning-based methods and challenges COLMAP while having lower runtime.

Geometry Transfer for Stylizing Radiance Fields,"Jung, Hyunyoung, Nam, Seonghyeon, Sarafianos, Nikolaos, Yoo, Sungjoo, Sorkine-Hornung, Alexander, Ranjan, Rakesh",Shape and geometric patterns are essential in defining stylistic identity. However current 3D style transfer methods predominantly focus on transferring colors and textures often overlooking geometric aspects. In this paper we introduce Geometry Transfer a novel method that leverages geometric deformation for 3D style transfer. This technique employs depth maps to extract a style guide subsequently applied to stylize the geometry of radiance fields. Moreover we propose new techniques that utilize geometric cues from the 3D scene thereby enhancing aesthetic expressiveness and more accurately reflecting intended styles. Our extensive experiments show that Geometry Transfer enables a broader and more expressive range of stylizations thereby significantly expanding the scope of 3D style transfer.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jung_Geometry_Transfer_for_Stylizing_Radiance_Fields_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Holoported Characters: Real-time Free-viewpoint Rendering of Humans from Sparse RGB Cameras,"Shetty, Ashwath, Habermann, Marc, Sun, Guoxing, Luvizon, Diogo, Golyanik, Vladislav, Theobalt, Christian",We present the first approach to render highly realistic free-viewpoint videos of a human actor in general apparel from sparse multi-view recording to display in real-time at an unprecedented 4K resolution. At inference our method only requires four camera views of the moving actor and the respective 3D skeletal pose. It handles actors in wide clothing and reproduces even fine-scale dynamic detail e.g. clothing wrinkles face expressions and hand gestures. At training time our learning-based approach expects dense multi-view video and a rigged static surface scan of the actor. Our method comprises three main stages. Stage 1 is a skeleton-driven neural approach for high-quality capture of the detailed dynamic mesh geometry. Stage 2 is a novel solution to create a view-dependent texture using four test-time camera views as input. Finally stage 3 comprises a new image-based refinement network rendering the final 4K image given the output from the previous stages. Our approach establishes a new benchmark for real-time rendering resolution and quality using sparse input camera views unlocking possibilities for immersive telepresence.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shetty_Holoported_Characters_Real-time_Free-viewpoint_Rendering_of_Humans_from_Sparse_RGB_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SEAS: ShapE-Aligned Supervision for Person Re-Identification,"Zhu, Haidong, Budhwant, Pranav, Zheng, Zhaoheng, Nevatia, Ram",We introduce SEAS using ShapE-Aligned Supervision to enhance appearance-based person re-identification. When recognizing an individual's identity existing methods primarily rely on appearance which can be influenced by the background environment due to a lack of body shape awareness. Although some methods attempt to incorporate other modalities such as gait or body shape they encode the additional modality separately resulting in extra computational costs and lacking an inherent connection with appearance. In this paper we explore the use of implicit 3-D body shape representations as pixel-level guidance to augment the extraction of identity features with body shape knowledge in addition to appearance. Using body shape as supervision rather than as input provides shape-aware enhancements without any increase in computational cost and delivers coherent integration with pixel-wise appearance features. Moreover for video-based person re-identification we align pixel-level features across frames with shape awareness to ensure temporal consistency. Our results demonstrate that incorporating body shape as pixel-level supervision reduces rank-1 errors by 1.4% for frame-based and by 2.5% for video-based re-identification tasks respectively and can also be generalized to other existing appearance-based person re-identification methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_SEAS_ShapE-Aligned_Supervision_for_Person_Re-Identification_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Making Vision Transformers Truly Shift-Equivariant,"Rojas-Gomez, Renan A., Lim, Teck-Yian, Do, Minh N., Yeh, Raymond A.",In the field of computer vision Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a prominent deep learning architecture. Despite being inspired by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ViTs are susceptible to small spatial shifts in the input data - they lack shift-equivariance. To address this shortcoming we introduce novel data-adaptive designs for each of the ViT modules that break shift-equivariance such as tokenization self-attention patch merging and positional encoding. With our proposed modules we achieve perfect circular shift-equivariance across four prominent ViT architectures: Swin SwinV2 CvT and MViTv2. Additionally we leverage our design to further enhance consistency under standard shifts. We evaluate our adaptive ViT models on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our models achieve competitive performance across three diverse datasets showcasing perfect (100%) circular shift consistency while improving standard shift consistency.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Rojas-Gomez_Making_Vision_Transformers_Truly_Shift-Equivariant_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SpikeNeRF: Learning Neural Radiance Fields from Continuous Spike Stream,"Zhu, Lin, Jia, Kangmin, Zhao, Yifan, Qi, Yunshan, Wang, Lizhi, Huang, Hua",Spike cameras leveraging spike-based integration sampling and high temporal resolution offer distinct advantages over standard cameras. However existing approaches reliant on spike cameras often assume optimal illumination a condition frequently unmet in real-world scenarios. To address this we introduce SpikeNeRF the first work that derives a NeRF-based volumetric scene representation from spike camera data. Our approach leverages NeRF's multi-view consistency to establish robust self-supervision effectively eliminating erroneous measurements and uncovering coherent structures within exceedingly noisy input amidst diverse real-world illumination scenarios. The framework comprises two core elements: a spike generation model incorporating an integrate-and-fire neuron layer and parameters accounting for non-idealities such as threshold variation and a spike rendering loss capable of generalizing across varying illumination conditions. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views from the novel continuous spike stream demonstrating advantages over other vision sensors in certain scenes. Empirical evaluations conducted on both real and novel realistically simulated sequences affirm the efficacy of our methodology. The dataset and source code are released at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/SpikeNeRF.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_SpikeNeRF_Learning_Neural_Radiance_Fields_from_Continuous_Spike_Stream_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
A Semi-supervised Nighttime Dehazing Baseline with Spatial-Frequency Aware and Realistic Brightness Constraint,"Cong, Xiaofeng, Gui, Jie, Zhang, Jing, Hou, Junming, Shen, Hao",Existing research based on deep learning has extensively explored the problem of daytime image dehazing. However few studies have considered the characteristics of nighttime hazy scenes. There are two distinctions between nighttime and daytime haze. First there may be multiple active colored light sources with lower illumination intensity in nighttime scenes which may cause haze glow and noise with localized coupled and frequency inconsistent characteristics. Second due to the domain discrepancy between simulated and real-world data unrealistic brightness may occur when applying a dehazing model trained on simulated data to real-world data. To address the above two issues we propose a semi-supervised model for real-world nighttime dehazing. First the spatial attention and frequency spectrum filtering are implemented as a spatial-frequency domain information interaction module to handle the first issue. Second a pseudo-label-based retraining strategy and a local window-based brightness loss for semi-supervised training process is designed to suppress haze and glow while achieving realistic brightness. Experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Deep Equilibrium Diffusion Restoration with Parallel Sampling,"Cao, Jiezhang, Shi, Yue, Zhang, Kai, Zhang, Yulun, Timofte, Radu, Van Gool, Luc",Diffusion model-based image restoration (IR) aims to use diffusion models to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded images achieving promising performance. Due to the inherent property of diffusion models most existing methods need long serial sampling chains to restore HQ images step-by-step resulting in expensive sampling time and high computation costs. Moreover such long sampling chains hinder understanding the relationship between inputs and restoration results since it is hard to compute the gradients in the whole chains. In this work we aim to rethink the diffusion model-based IR models through a different perspective i.e. a deep equilibrium (DEQ) fixed point system called DeqIR. Specifically we derive an analytical solution by modeling the entire sampling chain in these IR models as a joint multivariate fixed point system. Based on the analytical solution we can conduct parallel sampling and restore HQ images without training. Furthermore we compute fast gradients via DEQ inversion and found that initialization optimization can boost image quality and control the generation direction. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on typical IR tasks and real-world settings.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cao_Deep_Equilibrium_Diffusion_Restoration_with_Parallel_Sampling_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Gaussian Shell Maps for Efficient 3D Human Generation,"Abdal, Rameen, Yifan, Wang, Shi, Zifan, Xu, Yinghao, Po, Ryan, Kuang, Zhengfei, Chen, Qifeng, Yeung, Dit-Yan, Wetzstein, Gordon",Efficient generation of 3D digital humans is important in several industries including virtual reality social media and cinematic production. 3D generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality and diversity for generated assets. Current 3D GAN architectures however typically rely on volume representations which are slow to render thereby hampering the GAN training and requiring multi-view-inconsistent 2D upsamplers. Here we introduce Gaussian Shell Maps (GSMs) as a framework that connects SOTA generator network architectures with emerging 3D Gaussian rendering primitives using an articulable multi shell--based scaffold. In this setting a CNN generates a 3D texture stack with features that are mapped to the shells. The latter represent inflated and deflated versions of a template surface of a digital human in a canonical body pose. Instead of rasterizing the shells directly we sample 3D Gaussians on the shells whose attributes are encoded in the texture features. These Gaussians are efficiently and differentiably rendered. The ability to articulate the shells is important during GAN training and at inference time to deform a body into arbitrary user-defined poses. Our efficient rendering scheme bypasses the need for view-inconsistent upsamplers and achieves high-quality multi-view consistent renderings at a native resolution of 512 x512 pixels. We demonstrate that GSMs successfully generate 3D humans when trained on single-view datasets including SHHQ and DeepFashion.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Abdal_Gaussian_Shell_Maps_for_Efficient_3D_Human_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MoST: Motion Style Transformer Between Diverse Action Contents,"Kim, Boeun, Kim, Jungho, Chang, Hyung Jin, Choi, Jin Young",While existing motion style transfer methods are effective between two motions with identical content their performance significantly diminishes when transferring style between motions with different contents. This challenge lies in the lack of clear separation between content and style of a motion. To tackle this challenge we propose a novel motion style transformer that effectively disentangles style from content and generates a plausible motion with transferred style from a source motion. Our distinctive approach to achieving the goal of disentanglement is twofold: (1) a new architecture for motion style transformer with 'part-attentive style modulator across body parts' and 'Siamese encoders that encode style and content features separately'; (2) style disentanglement loss. Our method outperforms existing methods and demonstrates exceptionally high quality particularly in motion pairs with different contents without the need for heuristic post-processing. Codes are available at https://github.com/Boeun-Kim/MoST.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kim_MoST_Motion_Style_Transformer_Between_Diverse_Action_Contents_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Prompting Hard or Hardly Prompting: Prompt Inversion for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Mahajan, Shweta, Rahman, Tanzila, Yi, Kwang Moo, Sigal, Leonid",The quality of the prompts provided to text-to-image diffusion models determines how faithful the generated content is to the user's intent often requiring `prompt engineering'. To harness visual concepts from target images without prompt engineering current approaches largely rely on embedding inversion by optimizing and then mapping them to pseudo-tokens. However working with such high-dimensional vector representations is challenging because they lack semantics and interpretability and only allow simple vector operations when using them. Instead this work focuses on inverting the diffusion model to obtain interpretable language prompts directly. The challenge of doing this lies in the fact that the resulting optimization problem is fundamentally discrete and the space of prompts is exponentially large; this makes using standard optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent difficult. To this end we utilize a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space in the model. Further we leverage the findings that different timesteps of the diffusion process cater to different levels of detail in an image. The later noisy timesteps of the forward diffusion process correspond to the semantic information and therefore prompt inversion in this range provides tokens representative of the image semantics. We show that our approach can identify semantically interpretable and meaningful prompts for a target image which can be used to synthesize diverse images with similar content. We further illustrate the application of the optimized prompts in evolutionary image generation and concept removal.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mahajan_Prompting_Hard_or_Hardly_Prompting_Prompt_Inversion_for_Text-to-Image_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Unmixing Before Fusion: A Generalized Paradigm for Multi-Source-based Hyperspectral Image Synthesis,"Yu, Yang, Pan, Erting, Wang, Xinya, Wu, Yuheng, Mei, Xiaoguang, Ma, Jiayi",In the realm of AI data serves as a pivotal resource. Real-world hyperspectral images (HSIs) bearing wide spectral characteristics are particularly valuable. However the acquisition of HSIs is always costly and time-intensive resulting in a severe data-thirsty issue in HSI research and applications. Current solutions have not been able to generate a sufficient volume of diverse and reliable synthetic HSIs. To this end our study formulates a novel generalized paradigm for HSI synthesis i.e. unmixing before fusion that initiates with unmixing across multi-source data and follows by fusion-based synthesis. By integrating unmixing this work maps unpaired HSI and RGB data to a low-dimensional abundance space greatly alleviating the difficulty of generating high-dimensional samples. Moreover incorporating abundances inferred from unpaired RGB images into generative models allows for cost-effective supplementation of various realistic spatial distributions in abundance synthesis. Our proposed paradigm can be instrumental with a series of deep generative models filling a significant gap in the field and enabling the generation of vast high-quality HSI samples for large-scale downstream tasks. Extension experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of synthesized HSIs. The code is available at: HSI-Synthesis.github.io.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yu_Unmixing_Before_Fusion_A_Generalized_Paradigm_for_Multi-Source-based_Hyperspectral_Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CoDi: Conditional Diffusion Distillation for Higher-Fidelity and Faster Image Generation,"Mei, Kangfu, Delbracio, Mauricio, Talebi, Hossein, Tu, Zhengzhong, Patel, Vishal M., Milanfar, Peyman",Large generative diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation and offer immense potential for conditional generation tasks such as image enhancement restoration editing and compositing. However their widespread adoption is hindered by the high computational cost which limits their real-time application. To address this challenge we introduce a novel method dubbed CoDi that adapts a pre-trained latent diffusion model to accept additional image conditioning inputs while significantly reducing the sampling steps required to achieve high-quality results. Our method can leverage architectures such as ControlNet to incorporate conditioning inputs without compromising the model's prior knowledge gained during large scale pre-training. Additionally a conditional consistency loss enforces consistent predictions across diffusion steps effectively compelling the model to generate high-quality images with conditions in a few steps. Our conditional-task learning and distillation approach outperforms previous distillation methods achieving a new state-of-the-art in producing high-quality images with very few steps (e.g. 1-4) across multiple tasks including super-resolution text-guided image editing and depth-to-image generation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mei_CoDi_Conditional_Diffusion_Distillation_for_Higher-Fidelity_and_Faster_Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
X-Adapter: Adding Universal Compatibility of Plugins for Upgraded Diffusion Model,"Ran, Lingmin, Cun, Xiaodong, Liu, Jia-Wei, Zhao, Rui, Zijie, Song, Wang, Xintao, Keppo, Jussi, Shou, Mike Zheng",We introduce X-Adapter a universal upgrader to enable the pretrained plug-and-play modules (e.g. ControlNet LoRA) to work directly with the upgraded text-to-image diffusion model (e.g. SDXL) without further retraining. We achieve this goal by training an additional network to control the frozen upgraded model with the new text-image data pairs. In detail X-Adapter keeps a frozen copy of the old model to preserve the connectors of different plugins. Additionally X-Adapter adds trainable mapping layers that bridge the decoders from models of different versions for feature remapping. The remapped features will be used as guidance for the upgraded model. To enhance the guidance ability of X-Adapter we employ a -text training strategy for the upgraded model. After training we also introduce a two-stage denoising strategy to align the initial latents of X-Adapter and the upgraded model. Thanks to our strategies X-Adapter demonstrates universal compatibility with various plugins and also enables plugins of different versions to work together thereby expanding the functionalities of diffusion community. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method we conduct extensive experiments and the results show that X-Adapter may facilitate wider application in the upgraded foundational diffusion model.

CADTalk: An Algorithm and Benchmark for Semantic Commenting of CAD Programs,"Yuan, Haocheng, Xu, Jing, Pan, Hao, Bousseau, Adrien, Mitra, Niloy J., Li, Changjian",CAD programs are a popular way to compactly encode shapes as a sequence of operations that are easy to parametrically modify. However without sufficient semantic comments and structure such programs can be challenging to understand let alone modify. We introduce the problem of semantic commenting CAD programs wherein the goal is to segment the input program into code blocks corresponding to semantically meaningful shape parts and assign a semantic label to each block. We solve the problem by combining program parsing with visual-semantic analysis afforded by recent advances in foundational language and vision models. Specifically by executing the input programs we create shapes which we use to generate conditional photorealistic images to make use of semantic annotators for such images. We then distill the information across the images and link back to the original programs to semantically comment on them. Additionally we collected and annotated a benchmark dataset CADTalk consisting of 5288 machine-made programs and 45 human-made programs with ground truth semantic comments. We extensively evaluated our approach compared it to a GPT-based baseline and an open-set shape segmentation baseline and reported an 83.24% accuracy on the new CADTalk dataset.

Inversion-Free Image Editing with Language-Guided Diffusion Models,"Xu, Sihan, Huang, Yidong, Pan, Jiayi, Ma, Ziqiao, Chai, Joyce",Despite recent advances in inversion-based editing text-guided image manipulation remains challenging for diffusion models. The primary bottlenecks include 1) the time-consuming nature of the inversion process; 2) the struggle to balance consistency with accuracy; 3) the lack of compatibility with efficient consistency sampling methods used in consistency models. To address the above issues we start by asking ourselves if the inversion process can be eliminated for editing. We show that when the initial sample is known a special variance schedule reduces the denoising step to the same form as the multi-step consistency sampling. We name this Denoising Diffusion Consistent Model (DDCM) and note that it implies a virtual inversion strategy without explicit inversion in sampling. We further unify the attention control mechanisms in a tuning-free framework for text-guided editing. Combining them we present inversion-free editing (InfEdit) which allows for consistent and faithful editing for both rigid and non-rigid semantic changes catering to intricate modifications without compromising on the image's integrity and explicit inversion. Through extensive experiments InfEdit shows strong performance in various editing tasks and also maintains a seamless workflow (less than 3 seconds on one single A40) demonstrating the potential for real-time applications.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_Inversion-Free_Image_Editing_with_Language-Guided_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HumMUSS: Human Motion Understanding using State Space Models,"Mondal, Arnab, Alletto, Stefano, Tome, Denis",Understanding human motion from video is essential for a range of applications including pose estimation mesh recovery and action recognition. While state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on transformer-based architectures these approaches have limitations in practical scenarios. Transformers are slower when sequentially predicting on a continuous stream of frames in real-time and do not generalize to new frame rates. In light of these constraints we propose a novel attention-free spatiotemporal model for human motion understanding building upon recent advancements in state space models. Our model not only matches the performance of transformer-based models in various motion understanding tasks but also brings added benefits like adaptability to different video frame rates and enhanced training speed when working with longer sequence of keypoints. Moreover the proposed model supports both offline and real-time applications. For real-time sequential prediction our model is both memory efficient and several times faster than transformer-based approaches while maintaining their high accuracy.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mondal_HumMUSS_Human_Motion_Understanding_using_State_Space_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Drag Your Noise: Interactive Point-based Editing via Diffusion Semantic Propagation,"Liu, Haofeng, Xu, Chenshu, Yang, Yifei, Zeng, Lihua, He, Shengfeng",Point-based interactive editing serves as an essential tool to complement the controllability of existing generative models. A concurrent work DragDiffusion updates the diffusion latent map in response to user inputs causing global latent map alterations. This results in imprecise preservation of the original content and unsuccessful editing due to gradient vanishing. In contrast we present DragNoise offering robust and accelerated editing without retracing the latent map. The core rationale of DragNoise lies in utilizing the predicted noise output of each U-Net as a semantic editor. This approach is grounded in two critical observations: firstly the bottleneck features of U-Net inherently possess semantically rich features ideal for interactive editing; secondly high-level semantics established early in the denoising process show minimal variation in subsequent stages. Leveraging these insights DragNoise edits diffusion semantics in a single denoising step and efficiently propagates these changes ensuring stability and efficiency in diffusion editing. Comparative experiments reveal that DragNoise achieves superior control and semantic retention reducing the optimization time by over 50% compared to DragDiffusion.

ContextSeg: Sketch Semantic Segmentation by Querying the Context with Attention,"Wang, Jiawei, Li, Changjian",Sketch semantic segmentation is a well-explored and pivotal problem in computer vision involving the assignment of predefined part labels to individual strokes. This paper presents ContextSeg - a simple yet highly effective approach to tackling this problem with two stages. In the first stage to better encode the shape and positional information of strokes we propose to predict an extra dense distance field in an autoencoder network to reinforce structural information learning. In the second stage we treat an entire stroke as a single entity and label a group of strokes within the same semantic part using an autoregressive Transformer with the default attention mechanism. By group-based labeling our method can fully leverage the context information when making decisions for the remaining groups of strokes. Our method achieves the best segmentation accuracy compared with state-of-the-art approaches on two representative datasets and has been extensively evaluated demonstrating its superior performance. Additionally we offer insights into solving part imbalance in training data and the preliminary experiment on cross-category training which can inspire future research in this field.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_ContextSeg_Sketch_Semantic_Segmentation_by_Querying_the_Context_with_Attention_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Taming the Tail in Class-Conditional GANs: Knowledge Sharing via Unconditional Training at Lower Resolutions,"Khorram, Saeed, Jiang, Mingqi, Shahbazi, Mohamad, Danesh, Mohamad H., Fuxin, Li",Despite extensive research on training generative adversarial networks (GANs) with limited training data learning to generate images from long-tailed training distributions remains fairly unexplored. In the presence of imbalanced multi-class training data GANs tend to favor classes with more samples leading to the generation of low quality and less diverse samples in tail classes. In this study we aim to improve the training of class-conditional GANs with long-tailed data. We propose a straightforward yet effective method for knowledge sharing allowing tail classes to borrow from the rich information from classes with more abundant training data. More concretely we propose modifications to existing class-conditional GAN architectures to ensure that the lower-resolution layers of the generator are trained entirely unconditionally while reserving class-conditional generation for the higher-resolution layers. Experiments on several long-tail benchmarks and GAN architectures demonstrate a significant improvement over existing methods in both the diversity and fidelity of the generated images.

VideoSwap: Customized Video Subject Swapping with Interactive Semantic Point Correspondence,"Gu, Yuchao, Zhou, Yipin, Wu, Bichen, Yu, Licheng, Liu, Jia-Wei, Zhao, Rui, Wu, Jay Zhangjie, Zhang, David Junhao, Shou, Mike Zheng, Tang, Kevin",Current diffusion-based video editing primarily focuses on structure-preserved editing by utilizing various dense correspondences to ensure temporal consistency and motion alignment. However these approaches are often ineffective when the target edit involves a shape change. To embark on video editing with shape change we explore customized video subject swapping in this work where we aim to replace the main subject in a source video with a target subject having a distinct identity and potentially different shape. In contrast to previous methods that rely on dense correspondences we introduce the VideoSwap framework that exploits semantic point correspondences inspired by our observation that only a small number of semantic points are necessary to align the subject's motion trajectory and modify its shape. We also introduce various user-point interactions (e.g. removing points and dragging points) to address various semantic point correspondence. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art video subject swapping results across a variety of real-world videos.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Gu_VideoSwap_Customized_Video_Subject_Swapping_with_Interactive_Semantic_Point_Correspondence_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Hierarchical Histogram Threshold Segmentation - Auto-terminating High-detail Oversegmentation,"Chang, Thomas V., Seibt, Simon, von Rymon Lipinski, Bartosz",Superpixels play a crucial role in image processing by partitioning an image into clusters of pixels with similar visual attributes. This facilitates subsequent image processing tasks offering computational advantages over the manipulation of individual pixels. While numerous oversegmentation techniques have emerged in recent years many rely on predefined initialization and termination criteria. In this paper a novel top-down superpixel segmentation algorithm called Hierarchical Histogram Threshold Segmentation (HHTS) is introduced. It eliminates the need for initialization and implements auto-termination outperforming state-of-the-art methods w.r.t boundary recall. This is achieved by iteratively partitioning individual pixel segments into foreground and background and applying intensity thresholding across multiple color channels. The underlying iterative process constructs a superpixel hierarchy that adapts to local detail distributions until color information exhaustion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of boundary adherence while maintaining competitive runtime performance on the BSDS500 and NYUV2 datasets. Furthermore an application of HHTS in refining machine learning-based semantic segmentation masks produced by the Segment Anything Foundation Model (SAM) is presented.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chang_Hierarchical_Histogram_Threshold_Segmentation_-_Auto-terminating_High-detail_Oversegmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Once for Both: Single Stage of Importance and Sparsity Search for Vision Transformer Compression,"Ye, Hancheng, Yu, Chong, Ye, Peng, Xia, Renqiu, Tang, Yansong, Lu, Jiwen, Chen, Tao, Zhang, Bo",Recent Vision Transformer Compression (VTC) works mainly follow a two-stage scheme where the importance score of each model unit is first evaluated or preset in each submodule followed by the sparsity score evaluation according to the target sparsity constraint. Such a separate evaluation process induces the gap between importance and sparsity score distributions thus causing high search costs for VTC. In this work for the first time we investigate how to integrate the evaluations of importance and sparsity scores into a single stage searching the optimal subnets in an efficient manner. Specifically we present OFB a cost-efficient approach that simultaneously evaluates both importance and sparsity scores termed Once for Both (OFB) for VTC. First a bi-mask scheme is developed by entangling the importance score and the differentiable sparsity score to jointly determine the pruning potential (prunability) of each unit. Such a bi-mask search strategy is further used together with a proposed adaptive one-hot loss to realize the progressive-and-efficient search for the most important subnet. Finally Progressive Masked Image Modeling (PMIM) is proposed to regularize the feature space to be more representative during the search process which may be degraded by the dimension reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OFB can achieve superior compression performance over state-of-the-art searching-based and pruning-based methods under various Vision Transformer architectures meanwhile promoting search efficiency significantly e.g. costing one GPU search day for the compression of DeiT-S on ImageNet-1K.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ye_Once_for_Both_Single_Stage_of_Importance_and_Sparsity_Search_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
As-Plausible-As-Possible: Plausibility-Aware Mesh Deformation Using 2D Diffusion Priors,"Yoo, Seungwoo, Kim, Kunho, Kim, Vladimir G., Sung, Minhyuk",We present As-Plausible-as-Possible (APAP) mesh deformation technique that leverages 2D diffusion priors to preserve the plausibility of a mesh under user-controlled deformation. Our framework uses per-face Jacobians to represent mesh deformations where mesh vertex coordinates are computed via a differentiable Poisson Solve. The deformed mesh is rendered and the resulting 2D image is used in the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) process which enables extracting meaningful plausibility priors from a pretrained 2D diffusion model. To better preserve the identity of the edited mesh we fine-tune our 2D diffusion model with LoRA. Gradients extracted by SDS and a user-prescribed handle displacement are then backpropagated to the per-face Jacobians and we use iterative gradient descent to compute the final deformation that balances between the user edit and the output plausibility. We evaluate our method with 2D and 3D meshes and demonstrate qualitative and quantitative improvements when using plausibility priors over geometry-preservation or distortion-minimization priors used by previous techniques.

ECLIPSE: Efficient Continual Learning in Panoptic Segmentation with Visual Prompt Tuning,"Kim, Beomyoung, Yu, Joonsang, Hwang, Sung Ju",Panoptic segmentation combining semantic and instance segmentation stands as a cutting-edge computer vision task. Despite recent progress with deep learning models the dynamic nature of real-world applications necessitates continual learning where models adapt to new classes (plasticity) over time without forgetting old ones (catastrophic forgetting). Current continual segmentation methods often rely on distillation strategies like knowledge distillation and pseudo-labeling which are effective but result in increased training complexity and computational overhead. In this paper we introduce a novel and efficient method for continual panoptic segmentation based on Visual Prompt Tuning dubbed ECLIPSE. Our approach involves freezing the base model parameters and fine-tuning only a small set of prompt embeddings addressing both catastrophic forgetting and plasticity and significantly reducing the trainable parameters. To mitigate inherent challenges such as error propagation and semantic drift in continual segmentation we propose logit manipulation to effectively leverage common knowledge across the classes. Experiments on ADE20K continual panoptic segmentation benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ECLIPSE notably its robustness against catastrophic forgetting and its reasonable plasticity achieving a new state-of-the-art. The code is available at https://github.com/clovaai/ECLIPSE.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kim_ECLIPSE_Efficient_Continual_Learning_in_Panoptic_Segmentation_with_Visual_Prompt_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MaGGIe: Masked Guided Gradual Human Instance Matting,"Huynh, Chuong, Oh, Seoung Wug, Shrivastava, Abhinav, Lee, Joon-Young",Human matting is a foundation task in image and video processing where human foreground pixels are extracted from the input. Prior works either improve the accuracy by additional guidance or improve the temporal consistency of a single instance across frames. We propose a new framework MaGGIe Masked Guided Gradual Human Instance Matting which predicts alpha mattes progressively for each human instances while maintaining the computational cost precision and consistency. Our method leverages modern architectures including transformer attention and sparse convolution to output all instance mattes simultaneously without exploding memory and latency. Although keeping constant inference costs in the multiple-instance scenario our framework achieves robust and versatile performance on our proposed synthesized benchmarks. With the higher quality image and video matting benchmarks the novel multi-instance synthesis approach from publicly available sources is introduced to increase the generalization of models in real-world scenarios. Our code and datasets are available at https://maggie-matt.github.io,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Huynh_MaGGIe_Masked_Guided_Gradual_Human_Instance_Matting_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Towards the Uncharted: Density-Descending Feature Perturbation for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Wang, Xiaoyang, Bai, Huihui, Yu, Limin, Zhao, Yao, Xiao, Jimin",Semi-supervised semantic segmentation allows model to mine effective supervision from unlabeled data to complement label-guided training. Recent research has primarily focused on consistency regularization techniques exploring perturbation-invariant training at both the image and feature levels. In this work we proposed a novel feature-level consistency learning framework named Density-Descending Feature Perturbation (DDFP). Inspired by the low-density separation assumption in semi-supervised learning our key insight is that feature density can shed a light on the most promising direction for the segmentation classifier to explore which is the regions with lower density. We propose to shift features with confident predictions towards lower-density regions by perturbation injection. The perturbed features are then supervised by the predictions on the original features thereby compelling the classifier to explore less dense regions to effectively regularize the decision boundary. Central to our method is the estimation of feature density. To this end we introduce a lightweight density estimator based on normalizing flow allowing for efficient capture of the feature density distribution in an online manner. By extracting gradients from the density estimator we can determine the direction towards less dense regions for each feature. The proposed DDFP outperforms other designs on feature-level perturbations and shows state of the art performances on both Pascal VOC and Cityscapes dataset under various partition protocols. The project is available at https://github.com/Gavinwxy/DDFP.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Towards_the_Uncharted_Density-Descending_Feature_Perturbation_for_Semi-supervised_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
RTMO: Towards High-Performance One-Stage Real-Time Multi-Person Pose Estimation,"Lu, Peng, Jiang, Tao, Li, Yining, Li, Xiangtai, Chen, Kai, Yang, Wenming",Real-time multi-person pose estimation presents significant challenges in balancing speed and precision. While two-stage top-down methods slow down as the number of people in the image increases existing one-stage methods often fail to simultaneously deliver high accuracy and real-time performance. This paper introduces RTMO a one-stage pose estimation framework that seamlessly integrates coordinate classification by representing keypoints using dual 1-D heatmaps within the YOLO architecture achieving accuracy comparable to top-down methods while maintaining high speed. We propose a dynamic coordinate classifier and a tailored loss function for heatmap learning specifically designed to address the incompatibilities between coordinate classification and dense prediction models. RTMO outperforms state-of-the-art one-stage pose estimators achieving 1.1% higher AP on COCO while operating about 9 times faster with the same backbone. Our largest model RTMO-l attains 74.8% AP on COCO val2017 and 141 FPS on a single V100 GPU demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy. The code and models are available at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/tree/main/projects/rtmo.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lu_RTMO_Towards_High-Performance_One-Stage_Real-Time_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
WaveFace: Authentic Face Restoration with Efficient Frequency Recovery,"Miao, Yunqi, Deng, Jiankang, Han, Jungong",Although diffusion models are rising as a powerful solution for blind face restoration they are criticized for two problems: 1) slow training and inference speed and 2) failure in preserving identity and recovering fine-grained facial details. In this work we propose WaveFace to solve the problems in the frequency domain where low- and high-frequency components decomposed by wavelet transformation are considered individually to maximize authenticity as well as efficiency. The diffusion model is applied to recover the low-frequency component only which presents general information of the original image but 1/16 in size. To preserve the original identity the generation is conditioned on the low-frequency component of low-quality images at each denoising step. Meanwhile high-frequency components at multiple decomposition levels are handled by a unified network which recovers complex facial details in a single step. Evaluations on four benchmark datasets show that: 1) WaveFace outperforms state-of-the-art methods in authenticity especially in terms of identity preservation and 2) authentic images are restored with the efficiency 10x faster than existing diffusion model-based BFR methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Miao_WaveFace_Authentic_Face_Restoration_with_Efficient_Frequency_Recovery_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
UltrAvatar: A Realistic Animatable 3D Avatar Diffusion Model with Authenticity Guided Textures,"Zhou, Mingyuan, Hyder, Rakib, Xuan, Ziwei, Qi, Guojun",Recent advances in 3D avatar generation have gained significant attention. These breakthroughs aim to produce more realistic animatable avatars narrowing the gap between virtual and real-world experiences. Most of existing works employ Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss combined with a differentiable renderer and text condition to guide a diffusion model in generating 3D avatars. However SDS often generates over-smoothed results with few facial details thereby lacking the diversity compared with ancestral sampling. On the other hand other works generate 3D avatar from a single image where the challenges of unwanted lighting effects perspective views and inferior image quality make them difficult to reliably reconstruct the 3D face meshes with the aligned complete textures. In this paper we propose a novel 3D avatar generation approach termed UltrAvatar with enhanced fidelity of geometry and superior quality of physically based rendering (PBR) textures without unwanted lighting. To this end the proposed approach presents a diffuse color extraction model and an authenticity guided texture diffusion model. The former removes the unwanted lighting effects to reveal true diffuse colors so that the generated avatars can be rendered under various lighting conditions. The latter follows two gradient-based guidances for generating PBR textures to render diverse face-identity features and details better aligning with 3D mesh geometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in the experiments.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_UltrAvatar_A_Realistic_Animatable_3D_Avatar_Diffusion_Model_with_Authenticity_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Attention-Propagation Network for Egocentric Heatmap to 3D Pose Lifting,"Kang, Taeho, Lee, Youngki",We present EgoTAP a heatmap-to-3D pose lifting method for highly accurate stereo egocentric 3D pose estimation. Severe self-occlusion and out-of-view limbs in egocentric camera views make accurate pose estimation a challenging problem. To address the challenge prior methods employ joint heatmaps-probabilistic 2D representations of the body pose but heatmap-to-3D pose conversion still remains an inaccurate process. We propose a novel heatmap-to-3D lifting method composed of the Grid ViT Encoder and the Propagation Network. The Grid ViT Encoder summarizes joint heatmaps into effective feature embedding using self-attention. Then the Propagation Network estimates the 3D pose by utilizing skeletal information to better estimate the position of obscure joints. Our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated by a 23.9% reduction of error in an MPJPE metric. Our source code is available on GitHub.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kang_Attention-Propagation_Network_for_Egocentric_Heatmap_to_3D_Pose_Lifting_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
OmniMotionGPT: Animal Motion Generation with Limited Data,"Yang, Zhangsihao, Zhou, Mingyuan, Shan, Mengyi, Wen, Bingbing, Xuan, Ziwei, Hill, Mitch, Bai, Junjie, Qi, Guo-Jun, Wang, Yalin",Our paper aims to generate diverse and realistic animal motion sequences from textual descriptions without a large-scale animal text-motion dataset. While the task of text-driven human motion synthesis is already extensively studied and benchmarked it remains challenging to transfer this success to other skeleton structures with limited data. In this work we design a model architecture that imitates Generative Pretraining Transformer (GPT) utilizing prior knowledge learned from human data to the animal domain. We jointly train motion autoencoders for both animal and human motions and at the same time optimize through the similarity scores among human motion encoding animal motion encoding and text CLIP embedding. Presenting the first solution to this problem we are able to generate animal motions with high diversity and fidelity quantitatively and qualitatively outperforming the results of training human motion generation baselines on animal data. Additionally we introduce AnimalML3D the first text-animal motion dataset with 1240 animation sequences spanning 36 different animal identities. We hope this dataset would mediate the data scarcity problem in text-driven animal motion generation providing a new playground for the research community.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yang_OmniMotionGPT_Animal_Motion_Generation_with_Limited_Data_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
InstanceDiffusion: Instance-level Control for Image Generation,"Wang, Xudong, Darrell, Trevor, Rambhatla, Sai Saketh, Girdhar, Rohit, Misra, Ishan",Text-to-image diffusion models produce high quality images but do not offer control over individual instances in the image. We introduce InstanceDiffusion that adds precise instance-level control to text-to-image diffusion models. InstanceDiffusion supports free-form language conditions per instance and allows flexible ways to specify instance locations such as simple single points scribbles bounding boxes or intricate instance segmentation masks and combinations thereof. We propose three major changes to text-to-image models that enable precise instance-level control. Our UniFusion block enables instance-level conditions for text-to-image models the ScaleU block improves image fidelity and our Multi-instance Sampler improves generations for multiple instances. InstanceDiffusion significantly surpasses specialized state-of-the-art models for each location condition. Notably on the COCO dataset we outperform previous state-of-the-art by 20.4% AP50box for box inputs and 25.4% IoU for mask inputs.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_InstanceDiffusion_Instance-level_Control_for_Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Unifying Top-down and Bottom-up Scanpath Prediction Using Transformers,"Yang, Zhibo, Mondal, Sounak, Ahn, Seoyoung, Xue, Ruoyu, Zelinsky, Gregory, Hoai, Minh, Samaras, Dimitris","Most models of visual attention aim at predicting either top-down or bottom-up control as studied using different visual search and free-viewing tasks. In this paper we propose the Human Attention Transformer (HAT) a single model that predicts both forms of attention control. HAT uses a novel transformer-based architecture and a simplified foveated retina that collectively create a spatio-temporal awareness akin to the dynamic visual working memory of humans. HAT not only establishes a new state-of-the-art in predicting the scanpath of fixations made during target-present and target-absent visual search and ""taskless"" free viewing but also makes human gaze behavior interpretable. Unlike previous methods that rely on a coarse grid of fixation cells and experience information loss due to fixation discretization HAT features a sequential dense prediction architecture and outputs a dense heatmap for each fixation thus avoiding discretizing fixations. HAT sets a new standard in computational attention which emphasizes effectiveness generality and interpretability. HAT's demonstrated scope and applicability will likely inspire the development of new attention models that can better predict human behavior in various attention-demanding scenarios.

3D-Aware Face Editing via Warping-Guided Latent Direction Learning,"Cheng, Yuhao, Chen, Zhuo, Ren, Xingyu, Zhu, Wenhan, Xu, Zhengqin, Xu, Di, Yang, Changpeng, Yan, Yichao",3D facial editing a longstanding task in computer vision with broad applications is expected to fast and intuitively manipulate any face from arbitrary viewpoints following the user's will. Existing works have limitations in terms of intuitiveness generalization and efficiency. To overcome these challenges we propose FaceEdit3D which allows users to directly manipulate 3D points to edit a 3D face achieving natural and rapid face editing. After one or several points are manipulated by users we propose the tri-plane warping to directly manipulate the view-independent 3D representation. To address the problem of distortion caused by tri-plane warping we train a warp-aware encoder to project the warped face onto a standardized latent space. In this space we further propose directional latent editing to mitigate the identity bias caused by the encoder and realize the disentangled editing of various attributes. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior results with rich facial details and nice identity preservation. Our approach also supports general applications like multi-attribute continuous editing and cat/car editing.

CAT-Seg: Cost Aggregation for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation,"Cho, Seokju, Shin, Heeseong, Hong, Sunghwan, Arnab, Anurag, Seo, Paul Hongsuck, Kim, Seungryong",Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation presents the challenge of labeling each pixel within an image based on a wide range of text descriptions. In this work we introduce a novel cost-based approach to adapt vision-language foundation models notably CLIP for the intricate task of semantic segmentation. Through aggregating the cosine similarity score i.e. the cost volume between image and text embeddings our method potently adapts CLIP for segmenting seen and unseen classes by fine-tuning its encoders addressing the challenges faced by existing methods in handling unseen classes. Building upon this we explore methods to effectively aggregate the cost volume considering its multi-modal nature of being established between image and text embeddings. Furthermore we examine various methods for efficiently fine-tuning CLIP.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cho_CAT-Seg_Cost_Aggregation_for_Open-Vocabulary_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Focus on Your Instruction: Fine-grained and Multi-instruction Image Editing by Attention Modulation,"Guo, Qin, Lin, Tianwei",Recently diffusion-based methods like InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) have achieved effective instruction-based image editing requiring only natural language instructions from the user. However these methods often inadvertently alter unintended areas and struggle with multi-instruction editing resulting in compromised outcomes. To address these issues we introduce the Focus on Your Instruction (FoI) a method designed to ensure precise and harmonious editing across multiple instructions without extra training or test-time optimization. In the FoI we primarily emphasize two aspects: (1) precisely extracting regions of interest for each instruction and (2) guiding the denoising process to concentrate within these regions of interest. For the first objective we identify the implicit grounding capability of IP2P from the cross-attention between instruction and image then develop an effective mask extraction method.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Guo_Focus_on_Your_Instruction_Fine-grained_and_Multi-instruction_Image_Editing_by_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AvatarGPT: All-in-One Framework for Motion Understanding Planning Generation and Beyond,"Zhou, Zixiang, Wan, Yu, Wang, Baoyuan",Large Language Models(LLMs) have shown remarkable emergent abilities in unifying almost all (if not every) NLP tasks. In the human motion-related realm however researchers still develop siloed models for each task. Inspired by InstuctGPT[??] and the generalist concept behind Gato [??] we introduce AvatarGPT an All-in-One framework for motion understanding planning generations as well as other tasks such as motion in-between synthesis. AvatarGPT treats each task as one type of instruction fine-tuned on the shared LLM. All the tasks are seamlessly interconnected with language as the universal interface constituting a closed-loop within the framework. To achieve this human motion sequences are first encoded as discrete tokens which serve as the extended vocabulary of LLM. Then an unsupervised pipeline to generate natural language descriptions of human action sequences from in-the-wild videos is developed. Finally all tasks are jointly trained. Extensive experiments show that AvatarGPT achieves SOTA on low-level tasks and promising results on high-level tasks demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed All-in-One framework. Moreover for the first time AvatarGPT enables a principled approach by iterative traversal of the tasks within the closed-loop for unlimited long-motion synthesis.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_AvatarGPT_All-in-One_Framework_for_Motion_Understanding_Planning_Generation_and_Beyond_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation via Motion-Decoupled Diffusion Model,"He, Xu, Huang, Qiaochu, Zhang, Zhensong, Lin, Zhiwei, Wu, Zhiyong, Yang, Sicheng, Li, Minglei, Chen, Zhiyi, Xu, Songcen, Wu, Xiaofei",Co-speech gestures if presented in the lively form of videos can achieve superior visual effects in human-machine interaction. While previous works mostly generate structural human skeletons resulting in the omission of appearance information we focus on the direct generation of audio-driven co-speech gesture videos in this work. There are two main challenges: 1) A suitable motion feature is needed to describe complex human movements with crucial appearance information. 2) Gestures and speech exhibit inherent dependencies and should be temporally aligned even of arbitrary length. To solve these problems we present a novel motion-decoupled framework to generate co-speech gesture videos. Specifically we first introduce a well-designed nonlinear TPS transformation to obtain latent motion features preserving essential appearance information. Then a transformer-based diffusion model is proposed to learn the temporal correlation between gestures and speech and performs generation in the latent motion space followed by an optimal motion selection module to produce long-term coherent and consistent gesture videos. For better visual perception we further design a refinement network focusing on missing details of certain areas. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing approaches in both motion and video-related evaluations.

CDFormer: When Degradation Prediction Embraces Diffusion Model for Blind Image Super-Resolution,"Liu, Qingguo, Zhuang, Chenyi, Gao, Pan, Qin, Jie",Existing Blind image Super-Resolution (BSR) methods focus on estimating either kernel or degradation information but have long overlooked the essential content details. In this paper we propose a novel BSR approach Content-aware Degradation-driven Transformer (CDFormer) to capture both degradation and content representations. However low-resolution images cannot provide enough content details and thus we introduce a diffusion-based module CDFormer_ diff  to first learn Content Degradation Prior (CDP) in both low- and high-resolution images and then approximate the real distribution given only low-resolution information. Moreover we apply an adaptive SR network CDFormer_ SR  that effectively utilizes CDP to refine features. Compared to previous diffusion-based SR methods we treat the diffusion model as an estimator that can overcome the limitations of expensive sampling time and excessive diversity. Experiments show that CDFormer can outperform existing methods establishing a new state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks under blind settings. Codes and models will be available at https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/CDFormer.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_CDFormer_When_Degradation_Prediction_Embraces_Diffusion_Model_for_Blind_Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HumanRef: Single Image to 3D Human Generation via Reference-Guided Diffusion,"Zhang, Jingbo, Li, Xiaoyu, Zhang, Qi, Cao, Yanpei, Shan, Ying, Liao, Jing",Generating a 3D human model from a single reference image is challenging because it requires inferring textures and geometries in invisible views while maintaining consistency with the reference image. Previous methods utilizing 3D generative models are limited by the availability of 3D training data. Optimization-based methods that lift text-to-image diffusion models to 3D generation often fail to preserve the texture details of the reference image resulting in inconsistent appearances in different views. In this paper we propose HumanRef a 3D human generation framework from a single-view input. To ensure the generated 3D model is photorealistic and consistent with the input image HumanRef introduces a novel method called reference-guided score distillation sampling (Ref-SDS) which effectively incorporates image guidance into the generation process. Furthermore we introduce region-aware attention to Ref-SDS ensuring accurate correspondence between different body regions. Experimental results demonstrate that HumanRef outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating 3D clothed humans with fine geometry photorealistic textures and view-consistent appearances.

Rethinking Interactive Image Segmentation with Low Latency High Quality and Diverse Prompts,"Liu, Qin, Cho, Jaemin, Bansal, Mohit, Niethammer, Marc",The goal of interactive image segmentation is to delineate specific regions within an image via visual or language prompts. Low-latency and high-quality interactive segmentation with diverse prompts remain challenging for existing specialist and generalist models. Specialist models with their limited prompts and task-specific designs experience high latency because the image must be recomputed every time the prompt is updated due to the joint encoding of image and visual prompts. Generalist models exemplified by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have recently excelled in prompt diversity and efficiency lifting image segmentation to the foundation model era. However for high-quality segmentations SAM still lags behind state-of-the-art specialist models despite SAM being trained with x100 more segmentation masks. In this work we delve deep into the architectural differences between the two types of models. We observe that dense representation and fusion of visual prompts are the key design choices contributing to the high segmentation quality of specialist models. In light of this we reintroduce this dense design into the generalist models to facilitate the development of generalist models with high segmentation quality. To densely represent diverse visual prompts we propose to use a dense map to capture five types: clicks boxes polygons scribbles and masks. Thus we propose SegNext a next-generation interactive segmentation approach offering low latency high quality and diverse prompt support. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on HQSeg-44K and DAVIS quantitatively and qualitatively.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Rethinking_Interactive_Image_Segmentation_with_Low_Latency_High_Quality_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DITTO: Dual and Integrated Latent Topologies for Implicit 3D Reconstruction,"Shim, Jaehyeok, Joo, Kyungdon",We propose a novel concept of dual and integrated latent topologies (DITTO in short) for implicit 3D reconstruction from noisy and sparse point clouds. Most existing methods predominantly focus on single latent type such as point or grid latents. In contrast the proposed DITTO leverages both point and grid latents (i.e. dual latent) to enhance their strengths the stability of grid latents and the detail-rich capability of point latents. Concretely DITTO consists of dual latent encoder and integrated implicit decoder. In the dual latent encoder a dual latent layer which is the key module block composing the encoder refines both latents in parallel maintaining their distinct shapes and enabling recursive interaction. Notably a newly proposed dynamic sparse point transformer within the dual latent layer effectively refines point latents. Then the integrated implicit decoder systematically combines these refined latents achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstruction and surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods on object- and scene-level datasets especially in thin and detailed structures.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shim_DITTO_Dual_and_Integrated_Latent_Topologies_for_Implicit_3D_Reconstruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HIT: Estimating Internal Human Implicit Tissues from the Body Surface,"Keller, Marilyn, Arora, Vaibhav, Dakri, Abdelmouttaleb, Chandhok, Shivam, Machann, J√ºrgen, Fritsche, Andreas, Black, Michael J., Pujades, Sergi",The creation of personalized anatomical digital twins is important in the fields of medicine computer graphics sports science and biomechanics. To observe a subject's anatomy expensive medical devices (MRI or CT) are required and the creation of the digital model is often time-consuming and involves manual effort. Instead we leverage the fact that the shape of the body surface is correlated with the internal anatomy; e.g. from surface observations alone one can predict body composition and skeletal structure. In this work we go further and learn to infer the 3D location of three important anatomic tissues: subcutaneous adipose tissue (fat) lean tissue (muscles and organs) and long bones. To learn to infer these tissues we tackle several key challenges. We first create a dataset of human tissues by segmenting full-body MRI scans and registering the SMPL body mesh to the body surface. With this dataset we train HIT (Human Implicit Tissues) an implicit function that given a point inside a body predicts its tissue class. HIT leverages the SMPL body model shape and pose parameters to canonicalize the medical data. Unlike SMPL which is trained from upright 3D scans MRI scans are acquired with subjects lying on a table resulting in significant soft-tissue deformation. Consequently HIT uses a learned volumetric deformation field that undoes these deformations. Since HIT is parameterized by SMPL we can repose bodies or change the shape of subjects and the internal structures deform appropriately. We perform extensive experiments to validate HIT's ability to predict a plausible internal structure for novel subjects. The dataset and HIT model are available at https://hit.is.tue.mpg.de to foster future research in this direction.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Keller_HIT_Estimating_Internal_Human_Implicit_Tissues_from_the_Body_Surface_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DanceCamera3D: 3D Camera Movement Synthesis with Music and Dance,"Wang, Zixuan, Jia, Jia, Sun, Shikun, Wu, Haozhe, Han, Rong, Li, Zhenyu, Tang, Di, Zhou, Jiaqing, Luo, Jiebo",Choreographers determine what the dances look like while cameramen determine the final presentation of dances. Recently various methods and datasets have showcased the feasibility of dance synthesis. However camera movement synthesis with music and dance remains an unsolved challenging problem due to the scarcity of paired data. Thus we present DCM a new multi-modal 3D dataset which for the first time combines camera movement with dance motion and music audio. This dataset encompasses 108 dance sequences (3.2 hours) of paired dance-camera-music data from the anime community covering 4 music genres. With this dataset we uncover that dance camera movement is multifaceted and human-centric and possesses multiple influencing factors making dance camera synthesis a more challenging task compared to camera or dance synthesis alone. To overcome these difficulties we propose DanceCamera3D a transformer-based diffusion model that incorporates a novel body attention loss and a condition separation strategy. For evaluation we devise new metrics measuring camera movement quality diversity and dancer fidelity. Utilizing these metrics we conduct extensive experiments on our DCM dataset providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence showcasing the effectiveness of our DanceCamera3D model. Code and video demos are available at https://github.com/ Carmenw1203/DanceCamera3D-Official.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_DanceCamera3D_3D_Camera_Movement_Synthesis_with_Music_and_Dance_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Cross Initialization for Face Personalization of Text-to-Image Models,"Pang, Lianyu, Yin, Jian, Xie, Haoran, Wang, Qiping, Li, Qing, Mao, Xudong",Recently there has been a surge in face personalization techniques benefiting from the advanced capabilities of pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Among these a notable method is Textual Inversion which generates personalized images by inverting given images into textual embeddings. However methods based on Textual Inversion still struggle with balancing the trade-off between reconstruction quality and editability. In this study we examine this issue through the lens of initialization. Upon closely examining traditional initialization methods we identified a significant disparity between the initial and learned embeddings in terms of both scale and orientation. The scale of the learned embedding can be up to 100 times greater than that of the initial embedding. Such a significant change in the embedding could increase the risk of overfitting thereby compromising the editability. Driven by this observation we introduce a novel initialization method termed Cross Initialization that significantly narrows the gap between the initial and learned embeddings. This method not only improves both reconstruction and editability but also reduces the optimization steps from 5000 to 320. Furthermore we apply a regularization term to keep the learned embedding close to the initial embedding. We show that when combined with Cross Initialization this regularization term can effectively improve editability. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence to demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to the baseline methods. Notably in our experiments Cross Initialization is the only method that successfully edits an individual's facial expression. Additionally a fast version of our method allows for capturing an input image in roughly 26 seconds while surpassing the baseline methods in terms of both reconstruction and editability.

LEDITS++: Limitless Image Editing using Text-to-Image Models,"Brack, Manuel, Friedrich, Felix, Kornmeier, Katharia, Tsaban, Linoy, Schramowski, Patrick, Kersting, Kristian, Passos, Apolinario",Text-to-image diffusion models have recently received increasing interest for their astonishing ability to produce high-fidelity images from solely text inputs. Subsequent research efforts aim to exploit and apply their capabilities to real image editing. However existing image-to-image methods are often inefficient imprecise and of limited versatility. They either require time-consuming fine-tuning deviate unnecessarily strongly from the input image and/or lack support for multiple simultaneous edits. To address these issues we introduce LEDITS++ an efficient yet versatile and precise textual image manipulation technique. LEDITS++'s novel inversion approach requires no tuning nor optimization and produces high-fidelity results with a few diffusion steps. Second our methodology supports multiple simultaneous edits and is architecture-agnostic. Third we use a novel implicit masking technique that limits changes to relevant image regions. We propose the novel TEdBench++ benchmark as part of our exhaustive evaluation. Our results demonstrate the capabilities of LEDITS++ and its improvements over previous methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Brack_LEDITS_Limitless_Image_Editing_using_Text-to-Image_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Video Interpolation with Diffusion Models,"Jain, Siddhant, Watson, Daniel, Tabellion, Eric, Ho?ynski, Aleksander, Poole, Ben, Kontkanen, Janne",We present VIDIM a generative model for video interpolation which creates short videos given a start and end frame. In order to achieve high fidelity and generate motions unseen in the input data VIDIM uses cascaded diffusion models to first generate the target video at low resolution and then generate the high-resolution video conditioned on the low-resolution generated video. We compare VIDIM to previous state-of-the-art methods on video interpolation and demonstrate how such works fail in most settings where the underlying motion is complex nonlinear or ambiguous while VIDIM can easily handle such cases. We additionally demonstrate how classifier-free guidance on the start and end frame and conditioning the superresolution model on the original high-resolution frames without additional parameters unlocks high-fidelity results. VIDIM is fast to sample from as it jointly denoises all the frames to be generated requires less than a billion parameters per diffusion model to produce compelling results and still enjoys scalability and improved quality at larger parameter counts.

Learning Adaptive Spatial Coherent Correlations for Speech-Preserving Facial Expression Manipulation,"Chen, Tianshui, Lin, Jianman, Yang, Zhijing, Qing, Chunmei, Lin, Liang",Speech-preserving facial expression manipulation (SPFEM) aims to modify facial emotions while meticulously maintaining the mouth animation associated with spoken content. Current works depend on inaccessible paired training samples for the person where two aligned frames exhibit the same speech content yet differ in emotional expression limiting the SPFEM applications in real-world scenarios. In this work we discover that speakers who convey the same content with different emotions exhibit highly correlated local facial animations providing valuable supervision for SPFEM. To capitalize on this insight we propose a novel adaptive spatial coherent correlation learning (ASCCL) algorithm which models the aforementioned correlation as an explicit metric and integrates the metric to supervise manipulating facial expression and meanwhile better preserving the facial animation of spoken contents. To this end it first learns a spatial coherent correlation metric ensuring the visual disparities of adjacent local regions of the image belonging to one emotion are similar to those of the corresponding counterpart of the image belonging to another emotion. Recognizing that visual disparities are not uniform across all regions we have also crafted a disparity-aware adaptive strategy that prioritizes regions that present greater challenges. During SPFEM model training we construct the adaptive spatial coherent correlation metric between corresponding local regions of the input and output images as addition loss to supervise the generation process. We conduct extensive experiments on variant datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ASCCL algorithm. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/jianmanlincjx/ASCCL,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Learning_Adaptive_Spatial_Coherent_Correlations_for_Speech-Preserving_Facial_Expression_Manipulation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
WHAM: Reconstructing World-grounded Humans with Accurate 3D Motion,"Shin, Soyong, Kim, Juyong, Halilaj, Eni, Black, Michael J.",The estimation of 3D human motion from video has progressed rapidly but current methods still have several key limitations. First most methods estimate the human in camera coordinates. Second prior work on estimating humans in global coordinates often assumes a flat ground plane and produces foot sliding. Third the most accurate methods rely on computationally expensive optimization pipelines limiting their use to offline applications. Finally existing video-based methods are surprisingly less accurate than single-frame methods. We address these limitations with WHAM (World-grounded Humans with Accurate Motion) which accurately and efficiently reconstructs 3D human motion in a global coordinate system from video. WHAM learns to lift 2D keypoint sequences to 3D using motion capture data and fuses this with video features integrating motion context and visual information. WHAM exploits camera angular velocity estimated from a SLAM method together with human motion to estimate the body's global trajectory. We combine this with a contact-aware trajectory refinement method that lets WHAM capture human motion in diverse conditions such as climbing stairs. WHAM outperforms all existing 3D human motion recovery methods across multiple in-the-wild benchmarks. Code is available for research purposes at http://wham.is.tue.mpg.de/.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shin_WHAM_Reconstructing_World-grounded_Humans_with_Accurate_3D_Motion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DiffPerformer: Iterative Learning of Consistent Latent Guidance for Diffusion-based Human Video Generation,"Wang, Chenyang, Zheng, Zerong, Yu, Tao, Lv, Xiaoqian, Zhong, Bineng, Zhang, Shengping, Nie, Liqiang",Existing diffusion models for pose-guided human video generation mostly suffer from temporal inconsistency in the generated appearance and poses due to the inherent randomization nature of the generation process. In this paper we propose a novel framework DiffPerformer to synthesize high-fidelity and temporally consistent human video. Without complex architecture modification or costly training DiffPerformer finetunes a pretrained diffusion model on a single video of the target character and introduces an implicit video representation as a proxy to learn temporally consistent guidance for the diffusion model. The guidance is encoded into VAE latent space and an iterative optimization loop is constructed between the implicit video representation and the diffusion model allowing to harness the smooth property of the implicit video representation and the generative capabilities of the diffusion model in a mutually beneficial way. Moreover we propose 3D-aware human flow as a temporal constraint during the optimization to explicitly model the correspondence between driving poses and human appearance. This alleviates the misalignment between guided poses and target performer and therefore maintains the appearance coherence under various motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_DiffPerformer_Iterative_Learning_of_Consistent_Latent_Guidance_for_Diffusion-based_Human_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Category-Level Multi-Part Multi-Joint 3D Shape Assembly,"Li, Yichen, Mo, Kaichun, Duan, Yueqi, Wang, He, Zhang, Jiequan, Shao, Lin",Shape assembly composes complex shapes geometries by arranging simple part geometries and has wide applications in autonomous robotic assembly and CAD modeling. Existing works focus on geometry reasoning and neglect the actual physical assembly process of matching and fitting joints which are the contact surfaces connecting different parts. In this paper we consider contacting joints for the task of multi-part assembly. A successful joint-optimized assembly needs to satisfy the bilateral objectives of shape structure and joint alignment. We propose a hierarchical graph learning approach composed of two levels of graph representation learning. The part graph takes part geometries as input to build the desired shape structure. The joint-level graph uses part joints information and focuses on matching and aligning joints. The two kinds of information are combined to achieve the bilateral objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods achieving better shape structure and higher joint alignment accuracy.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_Category-Level_Multi-Part_Multi-Joint_3D_Shape_Assembly_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
One-Shot Open Affordance Learning with Foundation Models,"Li, Gen, Sun, Deqing, Sevilla-Lara, Laura, Jampani, Varun",We introduce One-shot Open Affordance Learning (OOAL) where a model is trained with just one example per base object category but is expected to identify novel objects and affordances. While vision-language models excel at recognizing novel objects and scenes they often struggle to understand finer levels of granularity such as affordances. To handle this issue we conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing foundation models to explore their inherent understanding of affordances and assess the potential for data-limited affordance learning. We then propose a vision-language framework with simple and effective designs that boost the alignment between visual features and affordance text embeddings. Experiments on two affordance segmentation benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models with less than 1% of the full training data and exhibits reasonable generalization capability on unseen objects and affordances.

Don't Look into the Dark: Latent Codes for Pluralistic Image Inpainting,"Chen, Haiwei, Zhao, Yajie",We present a method for large-mask pluralistic image inpainting based on the generative framework of discrete latent codes. Our method learns latent priors discretized as tokens by only performing computations at the visible locations of the image. This is realized by a restrictive partial encoder that predicts the token label for each visible block a bidirectional transformer that infers the missing labels by only looking at these tokens and a dedicated synthesis network that couples the tokens with the partial image priors to generate coherent and pluralistic complete image even under extreme mask settings. Experiments on public benchmarks validate our design choices as the proposed method outperforms strong baselines in both visual quality and diversity metrics.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Dont_Look_into_the_Dark_Latent_Codes_for_Pluralistic_Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DiffEditor: Boosting Accuracy and Flexibility on Diffusion-based Image Editing,"Mou, Chong, Wang, Xintao, Song, Jiechong, Shan, Ying, Zhang, Jian",Large-scale Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized image generation over the last few years. Although owning diverse and high-quality generation capabilities translating these abilities to fine-grained image editing remains challenging. In this paper we propose DiffEditor to rectify two weaknesses in existing diffusion-based image editing: (1) in complex scenarios editing results often lack editing accuracy and exhibit unexpected artifacts; (2) lack of flexibility to harmonize editing operations e.g. imagine new content. In our solution we introduce image prompts in fine-grained image editing cooperating with the text prompt to better describe the editing content. To increase the flexibility while maintaining content consistency we locally combine stochastic differential equation (SDE) into the ordinary differential equation (ODE) sampling. In addition we incorporate regional score-based gradient guidance and a time travel strategy into the diffusion sampling further improving the editing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can efficiently achieve state-of-the-art performance on various fine-grained image editing tasks including editing within a single image (e.g. object moving resizing and content dragging) and across images (e.g. appearance replacing and object pasting). Our source code is released at https://github.com/MC-E/DragonDiffusion.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mou_DiffEditor_Boosting_Accuracy_and_Flexibility_on_Diffusion-based_Image_Editing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
InstructVideo: Instructing Video Diffusion Models with Human Feedback,"Yuan, Hangjie, Zhang, Shiwei, Wang, Xiang, Wei, Yujie, Feng, Tao, Pan, Yining, Zhang, Yingya, Liu, Ziwei, Albanie, Samuel, Ni, Dong",Diffusion models have emerged as the de facto paradigm for video generation. However their reliance on web-scale data of varied quality often yields results that are visually unappealing and misaligned with the textual prompts. To tackle this problem we propose InstructVideo to instruct text-to-video diffusion models with human feedback by reward fine-tuning. InstructVideo has two key ingredients: 1) To ameliorate the cost of reward fine-tuning induced by generating through the full DDIM sampling chain we recast reward fine-tuning as editing. By leveraging the diffusion process to corrupt a sampled video InstructVideo requires only partial inference of the DDIM sampling chain reducing fine-tuning cost while improving fine-tuning efficiency. 2) To mitigate the absence of a dedicated video reward model for human preferences we repurpose established image reward models e.g. HPSv2. To this end we propose Segmental Video Reward a mechanism to provide reward signals based on segmental sparse sampling and Temporally Attenuated Reward a method that mitigates temporal modeling degradation during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments both qualitative and quantitative validate the practicality and efficacy of using image reward models in InstructVideo significantly enhancing the visual quality of generated videos without compromising generalization capabilities. Code and models can be accessed through our project page https://instructvideo.github.io/.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yuan_InstructVideo_Instructing_Video_Diffusion_Models_with_Human_Feedback_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
On the Content Bias in Frechet Video Distance,"Ge, Songwei, Mahapatra, Aniruddha, Parmar, Gaurav, Zhu, Jun-Yan, Huang, Jia-Bin",Frechet Video Distance (FVD) a prominent metric for evaluating video generation models is known to conflict with human perception occasionally. In this paper we aim to explore the extent of FVD's bias toward frame quality over temporal realism and identify its sources. We first quantify the FVD's sensitivity to the temporal axis by decoupling the frame and motion quality and find that the FVD only increases slightly with larger temporal corruption. We then analyze the generated videos and show that via careful sampling from a large set of generated videos that do not contain motions one can drastically decrease FVD without improving the temporal quality. Both studies suggest FVD's basis towards the quality of individual frames. We show that FVD with features extracted from the recent large-scale self-supervised video models is less biased toward image quality. Finally we revisit a few real-world examples to validate our hypothesis.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ge_On_the_Content_Bias_in_Frechet_Video_Distance_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Image Neural Field Diffusion Models,"Chen, Yinbo, Wang, Oliver, Zhang, Richard, Shechtman, Eli, Wang, Xiaolong, Gharbi, Michael",Diffusion models have shown an impressive ability to model complex data distributions with several key advantages over GANs such as stable training better coverage of the training distribution's modes and the ability to solve inverse problems without extra training. However most diffusion models learn the distribution of fixed-resolution images. We propose to learn the distribution of continuous images by training diffusion models on image neural fields which can be rendered at any resolution and show its advantages over fixed-resolution models. To achieve this a key challenge is to obtain a latent space that represents photorealistic image neural fields. We propose a simple and effective method inspired by several recent techniques but with key changes to make the image neural fields photorealistic. Our method can be used to convert existing latent diffusion autoencoders into image neural field autoencoders. We show that image neural field diffusion models can be trained using mixed-resolution image datasets outperform fixed-resolution diffusion models followed by super-resolution models and can solve inverse problems with conditions applied at different scales efficiently.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Image_Neural_Field_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Discriminative Probing and Tuning for Text-to-Image Generation,"Qu, Leigang, Wang, Wenjie, Li, Yongqi, Zhang, Hanwang, Nie, Liqiang, Chua, Tat-Seng",Despite advancements in text-to-image generation (T2I) prior methods often face text-image misalignment problems such as relation confusion in generated images. Existing solutions involve cross-attention manipulation for better compositional understanding or integrating large language models for improved layout planning. However the inherent alignment capabilities of T2I models are still inadequate. By reviewing the link between generative and discriminative modeling we posit that T2I models' discriminative abilities may reflect their text-image alignment proficiency during generation. In this light we advocate bolstering the discriminative abilities of T2I models to achieve more precise text-to-image alignment for generation. We present a discriminative adapter built on T2I models to probe their discriminative abilities on two representative tasks and leverage discriminative fine-tuning to improve their text-image alignment. As a bonus of the discriminative adapter a self-correction mechanism can leverage discriminative gradients to better align generated images to text prompts during inference. Comprehensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios demonstrate our method's superior generation performance. Meanwhile it achieves state-of-the-art discriminative performance on the two discriminative tasks compared to other generative models. The code is available at https://dpt-t2i.github.io/.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Qu_Discriminative_Probing_and_Tuning_for_Text-to-Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Towards More Accurate Diffusion Model Acceleration with A Timestep Tuner,"Xia, Mengfei, Shen, Yujun, Lei, Changsong, Zhou, Yu, Zhao, Deli, Yi, Ran, Wang, Wenping, Liu, Yong-Jin",A diffusion model which is formulated to produce an image using thousands of denoising steps usually suffers from a slow inference speed. Existing acceleration algorithms simplify the sampling by skipping most steps yet exhibit considerable performance degradation. By viewing the generation of diffusion models as a discretized integral process we argue that the quality drop is partly caused by applying an inaccurate integral direction to a timestep interval. To rectify this issue we propose a timestep tuner that helps find a more accurate integral direction for a particular interval at the minimum cost. Specifically at each denoising step we replace the original parameterization by conditioning the network on a new timestep enforcing the sampling distribution towards the real one. Extensive experiments show that our plug-in design can be trained efficiently and boost the inference performance of various state-of-the-art acceleration methods especially when there are few denoising steps. For example when using 10 denoising steps on LSUN Bedroom dataset we improve the FID of DDIM from 9.65 to 6.07 simply by adopting our method for a more appropriate set of timesteps.

Rethinking Generalizable Face Anti-spoofing via Hierarchical Prototype-guided Distribution Refinement in Hyperbolic Space,"Hu, Chengyang, Zhang, Ke-Yue, Yao, Taiping, Ding, Shouhong, Ma, Lizhuang",Generalizable face anti-spoofing (FAS) approaches have drawn growing attention due to their robustness for diverse presentation attacks in unseen scenarios. Most previous methods always utilize domain generalization (DG) frameworks via directly aligning diverse source samples into a common feature space. However these methods neglect the hierarchical relations in FAS samples which may hinder the generalization ability by direct alignment. To address these issues we propose a novel Hierarchical Prototype-guided Distribution Refinement (HPDR) framework to learn embedding in hyperbolic space which facilitates the hierarchical relation construction. We also collaborate with prototype learning for hierarchical distribution refinement in hyperbolic space. In detail we propose the Hierarchical Prototype Learning to simultaneously guide domain alignment and improve the discriminative ability via constraining the multi-level relations between prototypes and instances in hyperbolic space. Moreover we design a Prototype-oriented Classifier which further considers relations between the sample and prototypes to improve the robustness of the final decision. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against previous competitors.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hu_Rethinking_Generalizable_Face_Anti-spoofing_via_Hierarchical_Prototype-guided_Distribution_Refinement_in_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
GenesisTex: Adapting Image Denoising Diffusion to Texture Space,"Gao, Chenjian, Jiang, Boyan, Li, Xinghui, Zhang, Yingpeng, Yu, Qian",We present GenesisTex a novel method for synthesizing textures for 3D geometries from text descriptions. GenesisTex adapts the pretrained image diffusion model to texture space by texture space sampling. Specifically we maintain a latent texture map for each viewpoint which is updated with predicted noise on the rendering of the corresponding viewpoint. The sampled latent texture maps are then decoded into a final texture map. During the sampling process we focus on both global and local consistency across multiple viewpoints: global consistency is achieved through the integration of style consistency mechanisms within the noise prediction network and low-level consistency is achieved by dynamically aligning latent textures. Finally we apply reference-based inpainting and img2img on denser views for texture refinement. Our approach overcomes the limitations of slow optimization in distillation-based methods and instability in inpainting-based methods. Experiments on meshes from various sources demonstrate that our method surpasses the baseline methods quantitatively and qualitatively.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Gao_GenesisTex_Adapting_Image_Denoising_Diffusion_to_Texture_Space_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Image-to-Image Matching via Foundation Models: A New Perspective for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation,"Wang, Yuan, Sun, Rui, Luo, Naisong, Pan, Yuwen, Zhang, Tianzhu",Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images of arbitrary categories specified by class labels or captions. However most previous best-performing methods whether pixel grouping methods or region recognition methods suffer from false matches between image features and category labels. We attribute this to the natural gap between the textual features and visual features. In this work we rethink how to mitigate false matches from the perspective of image-to-image matching and propose a novel relation-aware intra-modal matching (RIM) framework for OVS based on visual foundation models. RIM achieves robust region classification by firstly constructing diverse image-modal reference features and then matching them with region features based on relation-aware ranking distribution. The proposed RIM enjoys several merits. First the intra-modal reference features are better aligned circumventing potential ambiguities that may arise in cross-modal matching. Second the ranking-based matching process harnesses the structure information implicit in the inter-class relationships making it more robust than comparing individually. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that RIM outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins obtaining a lead of more than 10% in mIoU on PASCAL VOC benchmark,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Image-to-Image_Matching_via_Foundation_Models_A_New_Perspective_for_Open-Vocabulary_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
BigGait: Learning Gait Representation You Want by Large Vision Models,"Ye, Dingqiang, Fan, Chao, Ma, Jingzhe, Liu, Xiaoming, Yu, Shiqi",Gait recognition stands as one of the most pivotal remote identification technologies and progressively expands across research and industry communities. However existing gait recognition methods heavily rely on task-specific upstream driven by supervised learning to provide explicit gait representations like silhouette sequences which inevitably introduce expensive annotation costs and potential error accumulation. Escaping from this trend this work explores effective gait representations based on the all-purpose knowledge produced by task-agnostic Large Vision Models (LVMs) and proposes a simple yet efficient gait framework termed BigGait. Specifically the Gait Representation Extractor (GRE) within BigGait draws upon design principles from established gait representations effectively transforming all-purpose knowledge into implicit gait representations without requiring third-party supervision signals. Experiments on CCPG CAISA-B* and SUSTech1K indicate that BigGait significantly outperforms the previous methods in both within-domain and cross-domain tasks in most cases and provides a more practical paradigm for learning the next-generation gait representation. Finally we delve into prospective challenges and promising directions in LVMs-based gait recognition aiming to inspire future work in this emerging topic.

HOIST-Former: Hand-held Objects Identification Segmentation and Tracking in the Wild,"Narasimhaswamy, Supreeth, Nguyen, Huy Anh, Huang, Lihan, Hoai, Minh",We address the challenging task of identifying segmenting and tracking hand-held objects which is crucial for applications such as human action segmentation and performance evaluation. This task is particularly challenging due to heavy occlusion rapid motion and the transitory nature of objects being hand-held where an object may be held released and subsequently picked up again. To tackle these challenges we have developed a novel transformer-based architecture called HOIST-Former. HOIST-Former is adept at spatially and temporally segmenting hands and objects by iteratively pooling features from each other ensuring that the processes of identification segmentation and tracking of hand-held objects depend on the hands' positions and their contextual appearance. We further refine HOIST-Former with a contact loss that focuses on areas where hands are in contact with objects. Moreover we also contribute an in-the-wild video dataset called HOIST which comprises 4125 videos complete with bounding boxes segmentation masks and tracking IDs for hand-held objects. Through experiments on the HOIST dataset and two additional public datasets we demonstrate the efficacy of HOIST-Former in segmenting and tracking hand-held objects.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Narasimhaswamy_HOIST-Former_Hand-held_Objects_Identification_Segmentation_and_Tracking_in_the_Wild_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Contextrast: Contextual Contrastive Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"Sung, Changki, Kim, Wanhee, An, Jungho, Lee, Wooju, Lim, Hyungtae, Myung, Hyun",Despite great improvements in semantic segmentation challenges persist because of the lack of local/global contexts and the relationship between them. In this paper we propose Contextrast a contrastive learning-based semantic segmentation method that allows to capture local/global contexts and comprehend their relationships. Our proposed method comprises two parts: a) contextual contrastive learning (CCL) and b) boundary-aware negative (BANE) sampling. Contextual contrastive learning obtains local/global context from multi-scale feature aggregation and inter/intra-relationship of features for better discrimination capabilities. Meanwhile BANE sampling selects embedding features along the boundaries of incorrectly predicted regions to employ them as harder negative samples on our contrastive learning resolving segmentation issues along the boundary region by exploiting fine-grained details. We demonstrate that our Contextrast substantially enhances the performance of semantic segmentation networks outperforming state-of-the-art contrastive learning approaches on diverse public datasets e.g. Cityscapes CamVid PASCAL-C COCO-Stuff and ADE20K without an increase in computational cost during inference.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sung_Contextrast_Contextual_Contrastive_Learning_for_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AUEditNet: Dual-Branch Facial Action Unit Intensity Manipulation with Implicit Disentanglement,"Jin, Shiwei, Wang, Zhen, Wang, Lei, Liu, Peng, Bi, Ning, Nguyen, Truong",Facial action unit (AU) intensity plays a pivotal role in quantifying fine-grained expression behaviors which is an effective condition for facial expression manipulation. However publicly available datasets containing intensity annotations for multiple AUs remain severely limited often featuring a restricted number of subjects. This limitation places challenges to the AU intensity manipulation in images due to disentanglement issues leading researchers to resort to other large datasets with pretrained AU intensity estimators for pseudo labels. In addressing this constraint and fully leveraging manual annotations of AU intensities for precise manipulation we introduce AUEditNet. Our proposed model achieves impressive intensity manipulation across 12 AUs trained effectively with only 18 subjects. Utilizing a dual-branch architecture our approach achieves comprehensive disentanglement of facial attributes and identity without necessitating additional loss functions or implementing with large batch sizes. This approach offers a potential solution to achieve desired facial attribute editing despite the dataset's limited subject count. Our experiments demonstrate AUEditNet's superior accuracy in editing AU intensities affirming its capability in disentangling facial attributes and identity within a limited subject pool. AUEditNet allows conditioning by either intensity values or target images eliminating the need for constructing AU combinations for specific facial expression synthesis. Moreover AU intensity estimation as a downstream task validates the consistency between real and edited images confirming the effectiveness of our proposed AU intensity manipulation method.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jin_AUEditNet_Dual-Branch_Facial_Action_Unit_Intensity_Manipulation_with_Implicit_Disentanglement_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
BodyMAP - Jointly Predicting Body Mesh and 3D Applied Pressure Map for People in Bed,"Tandon, Abhishek, Goyal, Anujraaj, Clever, Henry M., Erickson, Zackory",Accurately predicting the 3D human posture and the pressure exerted on the body for people resting in bed visualized as a body mesh (3D pose & shape) with a 3D pressure map holds significant promise for healthcare applications particularly in the prevention of pressure ulcers. Current methods focus on singular facets of the problem---predicting only 2D/3D poses generating 2D pressure images predicting pressure only for certain body regions instead of the full body or forming indirect approximations to the 3D pressure map. In contrast we introduce BodyMAP which jointly predicts the human body mesh and 3D applied pressure map across the entire human body. Our network leverages multiple visual modalities incorporating both a depth image of a person in bed and its corresponding 2D pressure image acquired from a pressure-sensing mattress. The 3D pressure map is represented as a pressure value at each mesh vertex and thus allows for precise localization of high-pressure regions on the body. Additionally we present BodyMAP-WS a new formulation of pressure prediction in which we implicitly learn pressure in 3D by aligning sensed 2D pressure images with a differentiable 2D projection of the predicted 3D pressure maps. In evaluations with real-world human data our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art technique by 25% on both body mesh and 3D applied pressure map prediction tasks for people in bed.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Tandon_BodyMAP_-_Jointly_Predicting_Body_Mesh_and_3D_Applied_Pressure_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
KPConvX: Modernizing Kernel Point Convolution with Kernel Attention,"Thomas, Hugues, Tsai, Yao-Hung Hubert, Barfoot, Timothy D., Zhang, Jian",In the field of deep point cloud understanding KPConv is a unique architecture that uses kernel points to locate convolutional weights in space instead of relying on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) encodings. While it initially achieved success it has since been surpassed by recent MLP networks that employ updated designs and training strategies. Building upon the kernel point principle we present two novel designs: KPConvD (depthwise KPConv) a lighter design that enables the use of deeper architectures and KPConvX an innovative design that scales the depthwise convolutional weights of KPConvD with kernel attention values. Using KPConvX with a modern architecture and training strategy we are able to outperform current state-of-the-art approaches on the ScanObjectNN Scannetv2 and S3DIS datasets. We validate our design choices through ablation studies and release our code and models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Thomas_KPConvX_Modernizing_Kernel_Point_Convolution_with_Kernel_Attention_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Clockwork Diffusion: Efficient Generation With Model-Step Distillation,"Habibian, Amirhossein, Ghodrati, Amir, Fathima, Noor, Sautiere, Guillaume, Garrepalli, Risheek, Porikli, Fatih, Petersen, Jens",This work aims to improve the efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models. While diffusion models use computationally expensive UNet-based denoising operations in every generation step we identify that not all operations are equally relevant for the final output quality. In particular we observe that UNet layers operating on high-res feature maps are relatively sensitive to small perturbations. In contrast low-res feature maps influence the semantic layout of the final image and can often be perturbed with no noticeable change in the output. Based on this observation we propose Clockwork Diffusion a method that periodically reuses computation from preceding denoising steps to approximate low-res feature maps at one or more subsequent steps. For multiple base- lines and for both text-to-image generation and image editing we demonstrate that Clockwork leads to comparable or improved perceptual scores with drastically reduced computational complexity. As an example for Stable Diffusion v1.5 with 8 DPM++ steps we save 32% of FLOPs with negligible FID and CLIP change. We re- lease code at https://github.com/Qualcomm-AI-research/clockwork-diffusion,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Habibian_Clockwork_Diffusion_Efficient_Generation_With_Model-Step_Distillation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Pick-or-Mix: Dynamic Channel Sampling for ConvNets,"Kumar, Ashish, Kim, Daneul, Park, Jaesik, Behera, Laxmidhar",Channel pruning approaches for convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) deactivate the channels statically or dynamically and require special implementation. In addition channel squeezing in representative ConvNets is carried out via 1 x 1 convolutions which dominates a large portion of computations and network parameters. Given these challenges we propose an effective multi-purpose module for dynamic channel sampling namely Pick-or-Mix (PiX) which does not require special implementation. PiX divides a set of channels into subsets and then picks from them where the picking decision is dynamically made per each pixel based on the input activations. We plug PiX into prominent ConvNet architectures and verify its multi-purpose utilities. After replacing 1 x 1 channel squeezing layers in ResNet with PiX the network becomes 25% faster without losing accuracy. We show that PiX allows ConvNets to learn better data representation than widely adopted approaches to enhance networks' representation power (e.g. SE CBAM AFF SKNet and DWP). We also show that PiX achieves state-of-the-art performance on network downscaling and dynamic channel pruning applications.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kumar_Pick-or-Mix_Dynamic_Channel_Sampling_for_ConvNets_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DyBluRF: Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields from Blurry Monocular Video,"Sun, Huiqiang, Li, Xingyi, Shen, Liao, Ye, Xinyi, Xian, Ke, Cao, Zhiguo",Recent advancements in dynamic neural radiance field methods have yielded remarkable outcomes. However these approaches rely on the assumption of sharp input images. When faced with motion blur existing dynamic NeRF methods often struggle to generate high-quality novel views. In this paper we propose DyBluRF a dynamic radiance field approach that synthesizes sharp novel views from a monocular video affected by motion blur. To account for motion blur in input images we simultaneously capture the camera trajectory and object Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) trajectories within the scene. Additionally we employ a global cross-time rendering approach to ensure consistent temporal coherence across the entire scene. We curate a dataset comprising diverse dynamic scenes that are specifically tailored for our task. Experimental results on our dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in generating sharp novel views from motion-blurred inputs while maintaining spatial-temporal consistency of the scene.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sun_DyBluRF_Dynamic_Neural_Radiance_Fields_from_Blurry_Monocular_Video_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AAMDM: Accelerated Auto-regressive Motion Diffusion Model,"Li, Tianyu, Qiao, Calvin, Ren, Guanqiao, Yin, KangKang, Ha, Sehoon",Interactive motion synthesis is essential in creating immersive experiences in entertainment applications such as video games and virtual reality. However generating animations that are both high-quality and contextually responsive remains a challenge. Traditional techniques in the game industry can produce high-fidelity animations but suffer from high computational costs and poor scalability. Trained neural network models alleviate the memory and speed issues yet fall short on generating diverse motions. Diffusion models offer diverse motion synthesis with low memory usage but require expensive reverse diffusion processes. This paper introduces the Accelerated Auto-regressive Motion Diffusion Model (AAMDM) a novel motion synthesis framework designed to achieve quality diversity and efficiency all together. AAMDM integrates Denoising Diffusion GANs as a fast Generation Module and an Auto-regressive Diffusion Model as a Polishing Module. Furthermore AAMDM operates in a lower-dimensional embedded space rather than the full-dimensional pose space which reduces the training complexity as well as further improves the performance. We show that AAMDM outperforms existing methods in motion quality diversity and runtime efficiency through comprehensive quantitative analyses and visual comparisons. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of each algorithmic component through ablation studies.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_AAMDM_Accelerated_Auto-regressive_Motion_Diffusion_Model_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Towards Understanding Cross and Self-Attention in Stable Diffusion for Text-Guided Image Editing,"Liu, Bingyan, Wang, Chengyu, Cao, Tingfeng, Jia, Kui, Huang, Jun",Deep Text-to-Image Synthesis (TIS) models such as Stable Diffusion have recently gained significant popularity for creative text-to-image generation. However for domain-specific scenarios tuning-free Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) is of greater importance for application developers. This approach modifies objects or object properties in images by manipulating feature components in attention layers during the generation process. Nevertheless little is known about the semantic meanings that these attention layers have learned and which parts of the attention maps contribute to the success of image editing. In this paper we conduct an in-depth probing analysis and demonstrate that cross-attention maps in Stable Diffusion often contain object attribution information which can result in editing failures. In contrast self-attention maps play a crucial role in preserving the geometric and shape details of the source image during the transformation to the target image. Our analysis offers valuable insights into understanding cross and self-attention mechanisms in diffusion models. Furthermore based on our findings we propose a simplified yet more stable and efficient tuning-free procedure that modifies only the self-attention maps of specified attention layers during the denoising process. Experimental results show that our simplified method consistently surpasses the performance of popular approaches on multiple datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Towards_Understanding_Cross_and_Self-Attention_in_Stable_Diffusion_for_Text-Guided_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DiverGen: Improving Instance Segmentation by Learning Wider Data Distribution with More Diverse Generative Data,"Fan, Chengxiang, Zhu, Muzhi, Chen, Hao, Liu, Yang, Wu, Weijia, Zhang, Huaqi, Shen, Chunhua",Instance segmentation is data-hungry and as model capacity increases data scale becomes crucial for improving the accuracy. Most instance segmentation datasets today require costly manual annotation limiting their data scale. Models trained on such data are prone to overfitting on the training set especially for those rare categories. While recent works have delved into exploiting generative models to create synthetic datasets for data augmentation these approaches do not efficiently harness the full potential of generative models. To address these issues we introduce a more efficient strategy to construct generative datasets for data augmentation termed DiverGen. Firstly we provide an explanation of the role of generative data from the perspective of distribution discrepancy. We investigate the impact of different data on the distribution learned by the model. We argue that generative data can expand the data distribution that the model can learn thus mitigating overfitting. Additionally we find that the diversity of generative data is crucial for improving model performance and enhance it through various strategies including category diversity prompt diversity and generative model diversity. With these strategies we can scale the data to millions while maintaining the trend of model performance improvement. On the LVIS dataset DiverGen significantly outperforms the strong model X-Paste achieving +1.1 box AP and +1.1 mask AP across all categories and +1.9 box AP and +2.5 mask AP for rare categories. Our codes are available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/DiverGen.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Fan_DiverGen_Improving_Instance_Segmentation_by_Learning_Wider_Data_Distribution_with_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Learning Disentangled Identifiers for Action-Customized Text-to-Image Generation,"Huang, Siteng, Gong, Biao, Feng, Yutong, Chen, Xi, Fu, Yuqian, Liu, Yu, Wang, Donglin",This study focuses on a novel task in text-to-image (T2I) generation namely action customization. The objective of this task is to learn the co-existing action from limited data and generalize it to unseen humans or even animals. Experimental results show that existing subject-driven customization methods fail to learn the representative characteristics of actions and struggle in decoupling actions from context features including appearance. To overcome the preference for low-level features and the entanglement of high-level features we propose an inversion-based method Action-Disentangled Identifier (ADI) to learn action-specific identifiers from the exemplar images. ADI first expands the semantic conditioning space by introducing layer-wise identifier tokens thereby increasing the representational richness while distributing the inversion across different features. Then to block the inversion of action-agnostic features ADI extracts the gradient invariance from the constructed sample triples and masks the updates of irrelevant channels. To comprehensively evaluate the task we present an ActionBench that includes a variety of actions each accompanied by meticulously selected samples. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that our ADI outperforms existing baselines in action-customized T2I generation.

Automatic Controllable Colorization via Imagination,"Cong, Xiaoyan, Wu, Yue, Chen, Qifeng, Lei, Chenyang",We propose a framework for automatic colorization that allows for iterative editing and modifications. The core of our framework lies in an imagination module: by understanding the content within a grayscale image we utilize a pre-trained image generation model to generate multiple images that contain the same content. These images serve as references for coloring mimicking the process of human experts. As the synthesized images can be imperfect or different from the original grayscale image we propose a Reference Refinement Module to select the optimal reference composition. Unlike most previous end-to-end automatic colorization algorithms our framework allows for iterative and localized modifications of the colorization results because we explicitly model the coloring samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing automatic colorization algorithms in editability and flexibility.

The recently presented MegaPortraits model has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in this domain. We conduct a deep examination and evaluation of this model with a particular focus on its latent space for facial expression descriptors and uncover several limitations with its ability to express intense face motions.

Open3DIS: Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation with 2D Mask Guidance,"Nguyen, Phuc, Ngo, Tuan Duc, Kalogerakis, Evangelos, Gan, Chuang, Tran, Anh, Pham, Cuong, Nguyen, Khoi",We introduce Open3DIS a novel solution designed to tackle the problem of Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation within 3D scenes. Objects within 3D environments exhibit diverse shapes scales and colors making precise instance-level identification a challenging task. Recent advancements in Open-Vocabulary scene understanding have made significant strides in this area by employing class-agnostic 3D instance proposal networks for object localization and learning queryable features for each 3D mask. While these methods produce high-quality instance proposals they struggle with identifying small-scale and geometrically ambiguous objects. The key idea of our method is a new module that aggregates 2D instance masks across frames and maps them to geometrically coherent point cloud regions as high-quality object proposals addressing the above limitations. These are then combined with 3D class-agnostic instance proposals to include a wide range of objects in the real world. To validate our approach we conducted experiments on three prominent datasets including ScanNet200 S3DIS and Replica demonstrating significant performance gains in segmenting objects with diverse categories over the state-of-the-art approaches.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Nguyen_Open3DIS_Open-Vocabulary_3D_Instance_Segmentation_with_2D_Mask_Guidance_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ControlRoom3D: Room Generation using Semantic Proxy Rooms,"Schult, Jonas, Tsai, Sam, H√∂llein, Lukas, Wu, Bichen, Wang, Jialiang, Ma, Chih-Yao, Li, Kunpeng, Wang, Xiaofang, Wimbauer, Felix, He, Zijian, Zhang, Peizhao, Leibe, Bastian, Vajda, Peter, Hou, Ji",Manually creating 3D environments for AR/VR applications is a complex process requiring expert knowledge in 3D modeling software. Pioneering works facilitate this process by generating room meshes conditioned on textual style descriptions. Yet many of these automatically generated 3D meshes do not adhere to typical room layouts compromising their plausibility e.g. by placing several beds in one bedroom. To address these challenges we present ControlRoom3D a novel method to generate high-quality room meshes. Central to our approach is a user-defined 3D semantic proxy room that outlines a rough room layout based on semantic bounding boxes and a textual description of the overall room style. Our key insight is that when rendered to 2D this 3D representation provides valuable geometric and semantic information to control powerful 2D models to generate 3D consistent textures and geometry that aligns well with the proxy room. Backed up by an extensive study including quantitative metrics and qualitative user evaluations our method generates diverse and globally plausible 3D room meshes thus empowering users to design 3D rooms effortlessly without specialized knowledge.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Schult_ControlRoom3D_Room_Generation_using_Semantic_Proxy_Rooms_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
UniPTS: A Unified Framework for Proficient Post-Training Sparsity,"Xie, Jingjing, Zhang, Yuxin, Lin, Mingbao, Cao, Liujuan, Ji, Rongrong",Post-training Sparsity (PTS) is a recently emerged avenue that chases efficient network sparsity with limited data in need. Existing PTS methods however undergo significant performance degradation compared with traditional methods that retrain the sparse networks via the whole dataset especially at high sparsity ratios. In this paper we attempt to reconcile this disparity by transposing three cardinal factors that profoundly alter the performance of conventional sparsity into the context of PTS. Our endeavors particularly comprise (1) A base-decayed sparsity objective that promotes efficient knowledge transferring from dense network to the sparse counterpart. (2) A reducing-regrowing search algorithm designed to ascertain the optimal sparsity distribution while circumventing overfitting to the small calibration set in PTS. (3) The employment of dynamic sparse training predicated on the preceding aspects aimed at comprehensively optimizing the sparsity structure while ensuring training stability. Our proposed framework termed UniPTS is validated to be much superior to existing PTS methods across extensive benchmarks. As an illustration it amplifies the performance of POT a recently proposed recipe from 3.9% to 68.6% when pruning ResNet-50 at 90% sparsity ratio on ImageNet.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xie_UniPTS_A_Unified_Framework_for_Proficient_Post-Training_Sparsity_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HumanNorm: Learning Normal Diffusion Model for High-quality and Realistic 3D Human Generation,"Huang, Xin, Shao, Ruizhi, Zhang, Qi, Zhang, Hongwen, Feng, Ying, Liu, Yebin, Wang, Qing",Recent text-to-3D methods employing diffusion models have made significant advancements in 3D human generation. However these approaches face challenges due to the limitations of text-to-image diffusion models which lack an understanding of 3D structures. Consequently these methods struggle to achieve high-quality human generation resulting in smooth geometry and cartoon-like appearances. In this paper we propose HumanNorm a novel approach for high-quality and realistic 3D human generation. The main idea is to enhance the model's 2D perception of 3D geometry by learning a normal-adapted diffusion model and a normal-aligned diffusion model. The normal-adapted diffusion model can generate high-fidelity normal maps corresponding to user prompts with view-dependent and body-aware text. The normal-aligned diffusion model learns to generate color images aligned with the normal maps thereby transforming physical geometry details into realistic appearance. Leveraging the proposed normal diffusion model we devise a progressive geometry generation strategy and a multi-step Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss to enhance the performance of 3D human generation. Comprehensive experiments substantiate HumanNorm's ability to generate 3D humans with intricate geometry and realistic appearances. HumanNorm outperforms existing text-to-3D methods in both geometry and texture quality.

Cross-view and Cross-pose Completion for 3D Human Understanding,"Armando, Matthieu, Galaaoui, Salma, Baradel, Fabien, Lucas, Thomas, Leroy, Vincent, Br√©gier, Romain, Weinzaepfel, Philippe, Rogez, Gr√©gory",Human perception and understanding is a major domain of computer vision which like many other vision subdomains recently stands to gain from the use of large models pre-trained on large datasets. We hypothesize that the most common pre-training strategy of relying on general purpose object-centric image datasets such as ImageNet is limited by an important domain shift. On the other hand collecting domain-specific ground truth such as 2D or 3D labels does not scale well. Therefore we propose a pre-training approach based on self-supervised learning that works on human-centric data using only images. Our method uses pairs of images of humans: the first is partially masked and the model is trained to reconstruct the masked parts given the visible ones and a second image. It relies on both stereoscopic (cross-view) pairs and temporal (cross-pose) pairs taken from videos in order to learn priors about 3D as well as human motion. We pre-train a model for body-centric tasks and one for hand-centric tasks. With a generic transformer architecture these models outperform existing self-supervised pre-training methods on a wide set of human-centric downstream tasks and obtain state-of-the-art performance for instance when fine-tuning for model-based and model-free human mesh recovery.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Armando_Cross-view_and_Cross-pose_Completion_for_3D_Human_Understanding_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Efficient Scene Recovery Using Luminous Flux Prior,"Li, Zhongyu, Zhang, Lei",Scene recovery the restoration of images degraded by adverse weather conditions presents significant challenges for existing methods. Physical models constrained by their inherent assumptions often fail when these assumptions are not met; Deep learning models are powerful they are limited by the diversity of their training datasets leading to poor generalization and high computational demands. To address these limitations we propose the Luminous Flux Prior (LFP) to recover degraded images under diverse adverse weather without learning. Luminous flux a physical measure that reflects image brightness has a rate of change that demonstrates a significant correlation with transmission. Consequently we leverage this rate of change in luminous flux as prior knowledge to estimate transmission which in turn assists in image recovery. This approach reduces dependency on physical parameters and enhances adaptability to various weather. Experimental validation under diverse conditions such as sandstorms underwater environments and haze attests to the robustness of LFP in restoring clear images. With a time complexity of \mathcal O (N\log N) LFP enables real-time recovery making it a suitable for devices with limited computational resources.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_Efficient_Scene_Recovery_Using_Luminous_Flux_Prior_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Customize your NeRF: Adaptive Source Driven 3D Scene Editing via Local-Global Iterative Training,"He, Runze, Huang, Shaofei, Nie, Xuecheng, Hui, Tianrui, Liu, Luoqi, Dai, Jiao, Han, Jizhong, Li, Guanbin, Liu, Si",In this paper we target the adaptive source driven 3D scene editing task by proposing a CustomNeRF model that unifies a text description or a reference image as the editing prompt. However obtaining desired editing results conformed with the editing prompt is nontrivial since there exist two significant challenges including accurate editing of only foreground regions and multi-view consistency given a single-view reference image. To tackle the first challenge we propose a Local-Global Iterative Editing (LGIE) training scheme that alternates between foreground region editing and full-image editing aimed at foreground-only manipulation while preserving the background. For the second challenge we also design a class-guided regularization that exploits class priors within the generation model to alleviate the inconsistency problem among different views in image-driven editing. Extensive experiments show that our CustomNeRF produces precise editing results under various real scenes for both text- and image-driven settings. The code is available at: https://github. com/hrz2000/CustomNeRF.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/He_Customize_your_NeRF_Adaptive_Source_Driven_3D_Scene_Editing_via_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Spherical Mask: Coarse-to-Fine 3D Point Cloud Instance Segmentation with Spherical Representation,"Shin, Sangyun, Zhou, Kaichen, Vankadari, Madhu, Markham, Andrew, Trigoni, Niki",Coarse-to-fine 3D instance segmentation methods show weak performances compared to recent Grouping-based Kernel-based and Transformer-based methods. We argue that this is due to two limitations: 1) Instance size overestimation by axis-aligned bounding box(AABB) 2) False negative error accumulation from inaccurate box to the refinement phase. In this work we introduce Spherical Mask a novel coarse-to-fine approach based on spherical representation overcoming those two limitations with several benefits. Specifically our coarse detection estimates each instance with a 3D polygon using a center and radial distance predictions which avoids excessive size estimation of AABB. To cut the error propagation in the existing coarse-to-fine approaches we virtually migrate points based on the polygon allowing all foreground points including false negatives to be refined. During inference the proposal and point migration modules run in parallel and are assembled to form binary masks of instances. We also introduce two margin-based losses for the point migration to enforce corrections for the false positives/negatives and cohesion of foreground points significantly improving the performance. Experimental results from three datasets such as ScanNetV2 S3DIS and STPLS3D show that our proposed method outperforms existing works demonstrating the effectiveness of the new instance representation with spherical coordinates.

FSRT: Facial Scene Representation Transformer for Face Reenactment from Factorized Appearance Head-pose and Facial Expression Features,"Rochow, Andre, Schwarz, Max, Behnke, Sven",The task of face reenactment is to transfer the head motion and facial expressions from a driving video to the appearance of a source image which may be of a different person (cross-reenactment). Most existing methods are CNN-based and estimate optical flow from the source image to the current driving frame which is then inpainted and refined to produce the output animation. We propose a transformer-based encoder for computing a set-latent representation of the source image(s). We then predict the output color of a query pixel using a transformer-based decoder which is conditioned with keypoints and a facial expression vector extracted from the driving frame. Latent representations of the source person are learned in a self-supervised manner that factorize their appearance head pose and facial expressions. Thus they are perfectly suited for cross-reenactment. In contrast to most related work our method naturally extends to multiple source images and can thus adapt to person-specific facial dynamics. We also propose data augmentation and regularization schemes that are necessary to prevent overfitting and support generalizability of the learned representations. We evaluated our approach in a randomized user study. The results indicate superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art in terms of motion transfer quality and temporal consistency.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Rochow_FSRT_Facial_Scene_Representation_Transformer_for_Face_Reenactment_from_Factorized_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
TetraSphere: A Neural Descriptor for O(3)-Invariant Point Cloud Analysis,"Melnyk, Pavlo, Robinson, Andreas, Felsberg, Michael, Wadenb√§ck, M√•rten",In many practical applications 3D point cloud analysis requires rotation invariance. In this paper we present a learnable descriptor invariant under 3D rotations and reflections i.e. the O(3) actions utilizing the recently introduced steerable 3D spherical neurons and vector neurons. Specifically we propose an embedding of the 3D spherical neurons into 4D vector neurons which leverages end-to-end training of the model. In our approach we perform TetraTransform---an equivariant embedding of the 3D input into 4D constructed from the steerable neurons---and extract deeper O(3)-equivariant features using vector neurons. This integration of the TetraTransform into the VN-DGCNN framework termed TetraSphere negligibly increases the number of parameters by less than 0.0002%. TetraSphere sets a new state-of-the-art performance classifying randomly rotated real-world object scans of the challenging subsets of ScanObjectNN. Additionally TetraSphere outperforms all equivariant methods on randomly rotated synthetic data: classifying objects from ModelNet40 and segmenting parts of the ShapeNet shapes. Thus our results reveal the practical value of steerable 3D spherical neurons for learning in 3D Euclidean space.

WANDR: Intention-guided Human Motion Generation,"Diomataris, Markos, Athanasiou, Nikos, Taheri, Omid, Wang, Xi, Hilliges, Otmar, Black, Michael J.",Synthesizing natural human motions that enable a 3D human avatar to walk and reach for arbitrary goals in 3D space remains an unsolved problem with many applications. Existing methods (data-driven or using reinforcement learning) are limited in terms of generalization and motion naturalness. A primary obstacle is the scarcity of training data that combines locomotion with goal reaching. To address this we introduce WANDR a data-driven model that takes an avatar's initial pose and a goal's 3D position and generates natural human motions that place the end effector (wrist) on the goal location. To solve this we introduce novel intention features that drive rich goal-oriented movement. Intention guides the agent to the goal and interactively adapts the generation to novel situations without needing to define sub-goals or the entire motion path. Crucially intention allows training on datasets that have goal-oriented motions as well as those that do not. WANDR is a conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (c-VAE) which we train using the AMASS and CIRCLE datasets. We evaluate our method extensively and demonstrate its ability to generate natural and long-term motions that reach 3D goals and generalize to unseen goal locations. Our models and code are available for research purposes at wandr.is.tue.mpg.de,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Diomataris_WANDR_Intention-guided_Human_Motion_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
GroupContrast: Semantic-aware Self-supervised Representation Learning for 3D Understanding,"Wang, Chengyao, Jiang, Li, Wu, Xiaoyang, Tian, Zhuotao, Peng, Bohao, Zhao, Hengshuang, Jia, Jiaya",Self-supervised 3D representation learning aims to learn effective representations from large-scale unlabeled point clouds. Most existing approaches adopt point discrimination as the pretext task which assigns matched points in two distinct views as positive pairs and unmatched points as negative pairs. However this approach often results in semantically identical points having dissimilar representations leading to a high number of false negatives and introducing a semantic conflict problem. To address this issue we propose GroupContrast a novel approach that combines segment grouping and semantic-aware contrastive learning. Segment grouping partitions points into semantically meaningful regions which enhances semantic coherence and provides semantic guidance for the subsequent contrastive representation learning. Semantic-aware contrastive learning augments the semantic information extracted from segment grouping and helps to alleviate the issue of semantic conflict. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks. The results demonstrate that GroupContrast learns semantically meaningful representations and achieves promising transfer learning performance.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_GroupContrast_Semantic-aware_Self-supervised_Representation_Learning_for_3D_Understanding_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Privacy-Preserving Face Recognition Using Trainable Feature Subtraction,"Mi, Yuxi, Zhong, Zhizhou, Huang, Yuge, Ji, Jiazhen, Xu, Jianqing, Wang, Jun, Wang, Shaoming, Ding, Shouhong, Zhou, Shuigeng",The widespread adoption of face recognition has led to increasing privacy concerns as unauthorized access to face images can expose sensitive personal information. This paper explores face image protection against viewing and recovery attacks. Inspired by image compression we propose creating a visually uninformative face image through feature subtraction between an original face and its model-produced regeneration. Recognizable identity features within the image are encouraged by co-training a recognition model on its high-dimensional feature representation. To enhance privacy the high-dimensional representation is crafted through random channel shuffling resulting in randomized recognizable images devoid of attacker-leverageable texture details. We distill our methodologies into a novel privacy-preserving face recognition method MinusFace. Experiments demonstrate its high recognition accuracy and effective privacy protection. Its code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/TFace.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mi_Privacy-Preserving_Face_Recognition_Using_Trainable_Feature_Subtraction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Learning Visual Prompt for Gait Recognition,"Ma, Kang, Fu, Ying, Cao, Chunshui, Hou, Saihui, Huang, Yongzhen, Zheng, Dezhi",Gait a prevalent and complex form of human motion plays a significant role in the field of long-range pedestrian retrieval due to the unique characteristics inherent in individual motion patterns. However gait recognition in real-world scenarios is challenging due to the limitations of capturing comprehensive cross-viewing and cross-clothing data. Additionally distractors such as occlusions directional changes and lingering movements further complicate the problem. The widespread application of deep learning techniques has led to the development of various potential gait recognition methods. However these methods utilize convolutional networks to extract shared information across different views and attire conditions. Once trained the parameters and non-linear function become constrained to fixed patterns limiting their adaptability to various distractors in real-world scenarios. In this paper we present a unified gait recognition framework to extract global motion patterns and develop a novel dynamic transformer to generate representative gait features. Specifically we develop a trainable part-based prompt pool with numerous key-value pairs that can dynamically select prompt templates to incorporate into the gait sequence thereby providing task-relevant shared knowledge information. Furthermore we specifically design dynamic attention to extract robust motion patterns and address the length generalization issue. Extensive experiments on four widely recognized gait datasets i.e. Gait3D GREW OUMVLP and CASIA-B reveal that the proposed method yields substantial improvements compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ma_Learning_Visual_Prompt_for_Gait_Recognition_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SC-GS: Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting for Editable Dynamic Scenes,"Huang, Yi-Hua, Sun, Yang-Tian, Yang, Ziyi, Lyu, Xiaoyang, Cao, Yan-Pei, Qi, Xiaojuan",Novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes is still a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Recently Gaussian splatting has emerged as a robust technique to represent static scenes and enable high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. Building upon this technique we propose a new representation that explicitly decomposes the motion and appearance of dynamic scenes into sparse control points and dense Gaussians respectively. Our key idea is to use sparse control points significantly fewer in number than the Gaussians to learn compact 6 DoF transformation bases which can be locally interpolated through learned interpolation weights to yield the motion field of 3D Gaussians. We employ a deformation MLP to predict time-varying 6 DoF transformations for each control point which reduces learning complexities enhances learning abilities and facilitates obtaining temporal and spatial coherent motion patterns. Then we jointly learn the 3D Gaussians the canonical space locations of control points and the deformation MLP to reconstruct the appearance geometry and dynamics of 3D scenes. During learning the location and number of control points are adaptively adjusted to accommodate varying motion complexities in different regions and an ARAP loss following the principle of as rigid as possible is developed to enforce spatial continuity and local rigidity of learned motions. Finally thanks to the explicit sparse motion representation and its decomposition from appearance our method can enable user-controlled motion editing while retaining high-fidelity appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing approaches on novel view synthesis with a high rendering speed and enables novel appearance-preserved motion editing applications.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Huang_SC-GS_Sparse-Controlled_Gaussian_Splatting_for_Editable_Dynamic_Scenes_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Tri-Modal Motion Retrieval by Learning a Joint Embedding Space,"Yin, Kangning, Zou, Shihao, Ge, Yuxuan, Tian, Zheng",Text-to-motion tasks have been the focus of recent advancements in the human motion domain. However the performance of text-to-motion tasks have not reached its potential primarily due to the lack of motion datasets and the pronounced gap between the text and motion modalities. To mitigate this challenge we introduce VLMA a novel Video-Language-Motion Alignment method. This approach leverages human-centric videos as an intermediary modality effectively bridging the divide between text and motion. By employing contrastive learning we construct a cohesive embedding space across the three modalities. Furthermore we incorporate a motion reconstruction branch ensuring that the resulting motion remains closely aligned with its original trajectory. Experimental evaluations on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in comparison to existing approaches. Furthermore we introduce a novel task termed video-to-motion retrieval designed to facilitate the seamlessxt eraction of corresponding 3D motions from an RGB video. Supplementary experiments demonstrate that our model is extensible to real-world human-centric videos offering a valuable complement to the pose estimation task.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yin_Tri-Modal_Motion_Retrieval_by_Learning_a_Joint_Embedding_Space_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Geometry-aware Reconstruction and Fusion-refined Rendering for Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields,"Liu, Tianqi, Ye, Xinyi, Shi, Min, Huang, Zihao, Pan, Zhiyu, Peng, Zhan, Cao, Zhiguo",Generalizable NeRF aims to synthesize novel views for unseen scenes. Common practices involve constructing variance-based cost volumes for geometry reconstruction and encoding 3D descriptors for decoding novel views. However existing methods show limited generalization ability in challenging conditions due to inaccurate geometry sub-optimal descriptors and decoding strategies. We address these issues point by point. First we find the variance-based cost volume exhibits failure patterns as the features of pixels corresponding to the same point can be inconsistent across different views due to occlusions or reflections. We introduce an Adaptive Cost Aggregation (ACA) approach to amplify the contribution of consistent pixel pairs and suppress inconsistent ones. Unlike previous methods that solely fuse 2D features into descriptors our approach introduces a Spatial-View Aggregator (SVA) to incorporate 3D context into descriptors through spatial and inter-view interaction. When decoding the descriptors we observe the two existing decoding strategies excel in different areas which are complementary. A Consistency-Aware Fusion (CAF) strategy is proposed to leverage the advantages of both. We incorporate the above ACA SVA and CAF into a coarse-to-fine framework termed Geometry-aware Reconstruction and Fusion-refined Rendering (GeFu). GeFu attains state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Geometry-aware_Reconstruction_and_Fusion-refined_Rendering_for_Generalizable_Neural_Radiance_Fields_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
VideoBooth: Diffusion-based Video Generation with Image Prompts,"Jiang, Yuming, Wu, Tianxing, Yang, Shuai, Si, Chenyang, Lin, Dahua, Qiao, Yu, Loy, Chen Change, Liu, Ziwei",Text-driven video generation witnesses rapid progress. However merely using text prompts is not enough to depict the desired subject appearance that accurately aligns with users' intents especially for customized content creation. In this paper we study the task of video generation with image prompts which provide more accurate and direct content control beyond the text prompts. Specifically we propose a feed-forward framework VideoBooth with two dedicated designs: 1) We propose to embed image prompts in a coarse-to-fine manner. Coarse visual embeddings from image encoder provide high-level encodings of image prompts while fine visual embeddings from the proposed attention injection module provide multi-scale and detailed encoding of image prompts. These two complementary embeddings can faithfully capture the desired appearance. 2) In the attention injection module at fine level multi-scale image prompts are fed into different cross-frame attention layers as additional keys and values. This extra spatial information refines the details in the first frame and then it is propagated to the remaining frames which maintains temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoBooth achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating customized high-quality videos with subjects specified in image prompts. Notably VideoBooth is a generalizable framework where a single model works for a wide range of image prompts with only feed-forward passes.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jiang_VideoBooth_Diffusion-based_Video_Generation_with_Image_Prompts_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SCULPT: Shape-Conditioned Unpaired Learning of Pose-dependent Clothed and Textured Human Meshes,"Sanyal, Soubhik, Ghosh, Partha, Yang, Jinlong, Black, Michael J., Thies, Justus, Bolkart, Timo",We present SCULPT a novel 3D generative model for clothed and textured 3D meshes of humans. Specifically we devise a deep neural network that learns to represent the geometry and appearance distribution of clothed human bodies. Training such a model is challenging as datasets of textured 3D meshes for humans are limited in size and accessibility. Our key observation is that there exist medium-sized 3D scan datasets like CAPE as well as large-scale 2D image datasets of clothed humans and multiple appearances can be mapped to a single geometry. To effectively learn from the two data modalities we propose an unpaired learning procedure for pose-dependent clothed and textured human meshes. Specifically we learn a pose-dependent geometry space from 3D scan data. We represent this as per vertex displacements w.r.t. the SMPL model. Next we train a geometry conditioned texture generator in an unsupervised way using the 2D image data. We use intermediate activations of the learned geometry model to condition our texture generator. To alleviate entanglement between pose and clothing type and pose and clothing appearance we condition both the texture and geometry generators with attribute labels such as clothing types for the geometry and clothing colors for the texture generator. We automatically generated these conditioning labels for the 2D images based on the visual question-answering model BLIP and CLIP. We validate our method on the SCULPT dataset and compare to state-of-the-art 3D generative models for clothed human bodies. Our code and data can be found at https://sculpt.is.tue.mpg.de.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sanyal_SCULPT_Shape-Conditioned_Unpaired_Learning_of_Pose-dependent_Clothed_and_Textured_Human_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
EasyDrag: Efficient Point-based Manipulation on Diffusion Models,"Hou, Xingzhong, Liu, Boxiao, Zhang, Yi, Liu, Jihao, Liu, Yu, You, Haihang",Generative models are gaining increasing popularity and the demand for precisely generating images is on the rise. However generating an image that perfectly aligns with users' expectations is extremely challenging. The shapes of objects the poses of animals the structures of landscapes and more may not match the user's desires and this applies to real images as well. This is where point-based image editing becomes essential. An excellent image editing method needs to meet the following criteria: user-friendly interaction high performance and good generalization capability. Due to the limitations of StyleGAN DragGAN exhibits limited robustness across diverse scenarios while DragDiffusion lacks user-friendliness due to the necessity of LoRA fine-tuning and masks. In this paper we introduce a novel interactive point-based image editing framework called EasyDrag that leverages pretrained diffusion models to achieve high-quality editing outcomes and user-friendship. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our approach surpasses DragDiffusion in terms of both image quality and editing precision for point-based image manipulation tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hou_EasyDrag_Efficient_Point-based_Manipulation_on_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
InterHandGen: Two-Hand Interaction Generation via Cascaded Reverse Diffusion,"Lee, Jihyun, Saito, Shunsuke, Nam, Giljoo, Sung, Minhyuk, Kim, Tae-Kyun",We present InterHandGen a novel framework that learns the generative prior of two-hand interaction. Sampling from our model yields plausible and diverse two-hand shapes in close interaction with or without an object. Our prior can be incorporated into any optimization or learning methods to reduce ambiguity in an ill-posed setup. Our key observation is that directly modeling the joint distribution of multiple instances imposes high learning complexity due to its combinatorial nature. Thus we propose to decompose the modeling of joint distribution into the modeling of factored unconditional and conditional single instance distribution. In particular we introduce a diffusion model that learns the single-hand distribution unconditional and conditional to another hand via conditioning dropout. For sampling we combine anti-penetration and classifier-free guidance to enable plausible generation. Furthermore we establish the rigorous evaluation protocol of two-hand synthesis where our method significantly outperforms baseline generative models in terms of plausibility and diversity. We also demonstrate that our diffusion prior can boost the performance of two-hand reconstruction from monocular in-the-wild images achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_InterHandGen_Two-Hand_Interaction_Generation_via_Cascaded_Reverse_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Video2Game: Real-time Interactive Realistic and Browser-Compatible Environment from a Single Video,"Xia, Hongchi, Lin, Zhi-Hao, Ma, Wei-Chiu, Wang, Shenlong",Creating high-quality and interactive virtual environments such as games and simulators often involves complex and costly manual modeling processes. In this paper we present Video2Game a novel approach that automatically converts videos of real-world scenes into realistic and interactive game environments. At the heart of our system are three core components: (i) a neural radiance fields (NeRF) module that effectively captures the geometry and visual appearance of the scene; (ii) a mesh module that distills the knowledge from NeRF for faster rendering; and (iii) a physics module that models the interactions and physical dynamics among the objects. By following the carefully designed pipeline one can construct an interactable and actionable digital replica of the real world. We benchmark our system on both indoor and large-scale outdoor scenes. We show that we can not only produce highly-realistic renderings in real-time but also build interactive games on top.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xia_Video2Game_Real-time_Interactive_Realistic_and_Browser-Compatible_Environment_from_a_Single_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Tackling the Singularities at the Endpoints of Time Intervals in Diffusion Models,"Zhang, Pengze, Yin, Hubery, Li, Chen, Xie, Xiaohua",Most diffusion models assume that the reverse process adheres to a Gaussian distribution. However this approximation has not been rigorously validated especially at singularities where t=0 and t=1. Improperly dealing with such singularities leads to an average brightness issue in applications and limits the generation of images with extreme brightness or darkness. We primarily focus on tackling singularities from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Initially we establish the error bounds for the reverse process approximation and showcase its Gaussian characteristics at singularity time steps. Based on this theoretical insight we confirm the singularity at t=1 is conditionally removable while it at t=0 is an inherent property. Upon these significant conclusions we propose a novel plug-and-play method SingDiffusion to address the initial singular time step sampling which not only effectively resolves the average brightness issue for a wide range of diffusion models without extra training efforts but also enhances their generation capability in achieving notable lower FID scores.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Tackling_the_Singularities_at_the_Endpoints_of_Time_Intervals_in_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CHAIN: Enhancing Generalization in Data-Efficient GANs via lipsCHitz continuity constrAIned Normalization,"Ni, Yao, Koniusz, Piotr",Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) significantly advanced image generation but their performance heavily depends on abundant training data. In scenarios with limited data GANs often struggle with discriminator overfitting and unstable training. Batch Normalization (BN) despite being known for enhancing generalization and training stability has rarely been used in the discriminator of Data-Efficient GANs. Our work addresses this gap by identifying a critical flaw in BN: the tendency for gradient explosion during the centering and scaling steps. To tackle this issue we present CHAIN (lipsCHitz continuity constrAIned Normalization) which replaces the conventional centering step with zero-mean regularization and integrates a Lipschitz continuity constraint in the scaling step. CHAIN further enhances GAN training by adaptively interpolating the normalized and unnormalized features effectively avoiding discriminator overfitting. Our theoretical analyses firmly establishes CHAIN's effectiveness in reducing gradients in latent features and weights improving stability and generalization in GAN training. Empirical evidence supports our theory. CHAIN achieves state-of-the-art results in data-limited scenarios on CIFAR-10/100 ImageNet five low-shot and seven high-resolution few-shot image datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ni_CHAIN_Enhancing_Generalization_in_Data-Efficient_GANs_via_lipsCHitz_continuity_constrAIned_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
High-Quality Facial Geometry and Appearance Capture at Home,"Han, Yuxuan, Lyu, Junfeng, Xu, Feng",Facial geometry and appearance capture have demonstrated tremendous success in 3D scanning real humans in studios. Recent works propose to democratize this technique while keeping the results high quality. However they are still inconvenient for daily usage. In addition they focus on an easier problem of only capturing facial skin. This paper proposes a novel method for high-quality face capture featuring an easy-to-use system and the capability to model the complete face with skin mouth interior hair and eyes. We reconstruct facial geometry and appearance from a single co-located smartphone flashlight sequence captured in a dim room where the flashlight is the dominant light source (e.g. rooms with curtains or at night). To model the complete face we propose a novel hybrid representation to effectively model both eyes and other facial regions along with novel techniques to learn it from images. We apply a combined lighting model to compactly represent real illuminations and exploit a morphable face albedo model as a reflectance prior to disentangle diffuse and specular. Experiments show that our method can capture high-quality 3D relightable scans. Our code will be released.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Han_High-Quality_Facial_Geometry_and_Appearance_Capture_at_Home_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Your Image is My Video: Reshaping the Receptive Field via Image-To-Video Differentiable AutoAugmentation and Fusion,"Casarin, Sofia, Ugwu, Cynthia I., Escalera, Sergio, Lanz, Oswald",The landscape of deep learning research is moving towards innovative strategies to harness the true potential of data. Traditionally emphasis has been on scaling model architectures resulting in large and complex neural networks which can be difficult to train with limited computational resources. However independently of the model size data quality (i.e. amount and variability) is still a major factor that affects model generalization. In this work we propose a novel technique to exploit available data through the use of automatic data augmentation for the tasks of image classification and semantic segmentation. We introduce the first Differentiable Augmentation Search method (DAS) to generate variations of images that can be processed as videos. Compared to previous approaches DAS is extremely fast and flexible allowing the search on very large search spaces in less than a GPU day. Our intuition is that the increased receptive field in the temporal dimension provided by DAS could lead to benefits also to the spatial receptive field. More specifically we leverage DAS to guide the reshaping of the spatial receptive field by selecting task-dependant transformations. As a result compared to standard augmentation alternatives we improve in terms of accuracy on ImageNet Cifar10 Cifar100 Tiny-ImageNet Pascal-VOC-2012 and CityScapes datasets when plugging-in our DAS over different light-weight video backbones.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Casarin_Your_Image_is_My_Video_Reshaping_the_Receptive_Field_via_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SpikingResformer: Bridging ResNet and Vision Transformer in Spiking Neural Networks,"Shi, Xinyu, Hao, Zecheng, Yu, Zhaofei",The remarkable success of Vision Transformers in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has led to a growing interest in incorporating the self-attention mechanism and transformer-based architecture into Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). While existing methods propose spiking self-attention mechanisms that are compatible with SNNs they lack reasonable scaling methods and the overall architectures proposed by these methods suffer from a bottleneck in effectively extracting local features. To address these challenges we propose a novel spiking self-attention mechanism named Dual Spike Self-Attention (DSSA) with a reasonable scaling method. Based on DSSA we propose a novel spiking Vision Transformer architecture called SpikingResformer which combines the ResNet-based multi-stage architecture with our proposed DSSA to improve both performance and energy efficiency while reducing parameters. Experimental results show that SpikingResformer achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower energy consumption than other spiking Vision Transformer counterparts. Notably our SpikingResformer-L achieves 79.40% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 4 time-steps which is the state-of-the-art result in the SNN field.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shi_SpikingResformer_Bridging_ResNet_and_Vision_Transformer_in_Spiking_Neural_Networks_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Self-Supervised Dual Contouring,"Sundararaman, Ramana, Klokov, Roman, Ovsjanikov, Maks",Learning-based isosurface extraction methods have recently emerged as a robust and efficient alternative to axiomatic techniques. However the vast majority of such approaches rely on supervised training with axiomatically computed ground truths thus potentially inheriting biases and data artefacts of the corresponding axiomatic methods. Steering away from such dependencies we propose a self-supervised training scheme to the Neural Dual Contouring meshing framework resulting in our method: Self-Supervised Dual Contouring (SDC). Instead of optimizing predicted mesh vertices with supervised training we use two novel self-supervised loss functions that encourage the consistency between distances to the generated mesh up to the first order. Meshes reconstructed by SDC surpass existing data-driven methods in capturing intricate details while being more robust to possible irregularities in the input. Furthermore we use the same self-supervised training objective linking inferred mesh and input SDF to regularize the training process of Deep Implicit Networks (DINs). We demonstrate that the resulting DINs produce higher-quality implicit functions ultimately leading to more accurate and detail-preserving surfaces compared to prior baselines for different input modalities. Finally we demonstrate that our self-supervised losses improve meshing performance in the single-view reconstruction task by enabling joint training of predicted SDF and resulting output mesh.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sundararaman_Self-Supervised_Dual_Contouring_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
GSVA: Generalized Segmentation via Multimodal Large Language Models,"Xia, Zhuofan, Han, Dongchen, Han, Yizeng, Pan, Xuran, Song, Shiji, Huang, Gao",Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES) extends the scope of classic RES to refer to multiple objects in one expression or identify the empty targets absent in the image. GRES poses challenges in modeling the complex spatial relationships of the instances in the image and identifying non-existing referents. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently shown tremendous progress in these complicated vision-language tasks. Connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision models MLLMs are proficient in understanding contexts with visual inputs. Among them LISA as a representative adopts a special [SEG] token to prompt a segmentation mask decoder e.g. SAM to enable MLLMs in the RES task. However existing solutions to GRES remain unsatisfactory since current segmentation MLLMs cannot correctly handle the cases where users might reference multiple subjects in a singular prompt or provide descriptions incongruent with any image target. In this paper we propose Generalized Segmentation Vision Assistant (GSVA) to address this gap. Specifically GSVA reuses the [SEG] token to prompt the segmentation model towards supporting multiple mask references simultaneously and innovatively learns to generate a [REJ] token to reject the targets explicitly. Experiments validate GSVA's efficacy in resolving the GRES issue marking a notable enhancement and setting a new record on the GRES benchmark gRefCOCO dataset. GSVA also proves effective across various classic referring segmentation and comprehension tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xia_GSVA_Generalized_Segmentation_via_Multimodal_Large_Language_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AdaBM: On-the-Fly Adaptive Bit Mapping for Image Super-Resolution,"Hong, Cheeun, Lee, Kyoung Mu",Although image super-resolution (SR) problem has experienced unprecedented restoration accuracy with deep neural networks it has yet limited versatile applications due to the substantial computational costs. Since different input images for SR face different restoration difficulties adapting computational costs based on the input image referred to as adaptive inference has emerged as a promising solution to compress SR networks. Specifically adapting the quantization bit-widths has successfully reduced the inference and memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy. However despite the benefits of the resultant adaptive network existing works rely on time-intensive quantization-aware training with full access to the original training pairs to learn the appropriate bit allocation policies which limits its ubiquitous usage. To this end we introduce the first on-the-fly adaptive quantization framework that accelerates the processing time from hours to seconds. We formulate the bit allocation problem with only two bit mapping modules: one to map the input image to the image-wise bit adaptation factor and one to obtain the layer-wise adaptation factors. These bit mappings are calibrated and fine-tuned using only a small number of calibration images. We achieve competitive performance with the previous adaptive quantization methods while the processing time is accelerated by x2000. Codes are available at https://github.com/Cheeun/AdaBM.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hong_AdaBM_On-the-Fly_Adaptive_Bit_Mapping_for_Image_Super-Resolution_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SVGDreamer: Text Guided SVG Generation with Diffusion Model,"Xing, Ximing, Zhou, Haitao, Wang, Chuang, Zhang, Jing, Xu, Dong, Yu, Qian",Recently text-guided scalable vector graphics (SVGs) synthesis has shown promise in domains such as iconography and sketch. However existing text-to-SVG generation methods lack editability and struggle with visual quality and result diversity. To address these limitations we propose a novel text-guided vector graphics synthesis method called SVGDreamer. SVGDreamer incorporates a semantic-driven image vectorization (SIVE) process that enables the decomposition of synthesis into foreground objects and background thereby enhancing editability. Specifically the SIVE process introduces attention-based primitive control and an attention-mask loss function for effective control and manipulation of individual elements. Additionally we propose a Vectorized Particle-based Score Distillation (VPSD) approach to address issues of shape over-smoothing color over-saturation limited diversity and slow convergence of the existing text-to-SVG generation methods by modeling SVGs as distributions of control points and colors. Furthermore VPSD leverages a reward model to re-weight vector particles which improves aesthetic appeal and accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of SVGDreamer demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods in terms of editability visual quality and diversity.

BlockGCN: Redefine Topology Awareness for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition,"Zhou, Yuxuan, Yan, Xudong, Cheng, Zhi-Qi, Yan, Yan, Dai, Qi, Hua, Xian-Sheng",Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have long set the state-of-the-art in skeleton-based action recognition leveraging their ability to unravel the complex dynamics of human joint topology through the graph's adjacency matrix. However an inherent flaw has come to light in these cutting-edge models: they tend to optimize the adjacency matrix jointly with the model weights. This process while seemingly efficient causes a gradual decay of bone connectivity data resulting in a model indifferent to the very topology it sought to represent. To remedy this we propose a two-fold strategy: (1) We introduce an innovative approach that encodes bone connectivity by harnessing the power of graph distances to describe the physical topology; we further incorporate action-specific topological representation via persistent homology analysis to depict systemic dynamics. This preserves the vital topological nuances often lost in conventional GCNs. (2) Our investigation also reveals the redundancy in existing GCNs for multi-relational modeling which we address by proposing an efficient refinement to Graph Convolutions (GC) - the BlockGC. This significantly reduces parameters while improving performance beyond original GCNs. Our full model BlockGCN establishes new benchmarks in skeleton-based action recognition across all model categories. Its high accuracy and lightweight design most notably on the large-scale NTU RGB+D 120 dataset stand as strong validation of the efficacy of BlockGCN.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_BlockGCN_Redefine_Topology_Awareness_for_Skeleton-Based_Action_Recognition_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Structure-Guided Adversarial Training of Diffusion Models,"Yang, Ling, Qian, Haotian, Zhang, Zhilong, Liu, Jingwei, Cui, Bin",Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in various generative applications. While existing models focus on minimizing a weighted sum of denoising score matching losses for data distribution modeling their training primarily emphasizes instance-level optimization overlooking valuable structural information within each mini-batch indicative of pair-wise relationships among samples. To address this limitation we introduce Structure-guided Adversarial training of Diffusion Models (SADM). In this pioneering approach we compel the model to learn manifold structures between samples in each training batch. To ensure the model captures authentic manifold structures in the data distribution we advocate adversarial training of the diffusion generator against a novel structure discriminator in a minimax game distinguishing real manifold structures from the generated ones. SADM substantially outperforms existing methods in image generation and cross-domain fine-tuning tasks across 12 datasets establishing a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.58 and 2.11 on ImageNet for class-conditional image generation at resolutions of 256x256 and 512x512 respectively.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yang_Structure-Guided_Adversarial_Training_of_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
NIFTY: Neural Object Interaction Fields for Guided Human Motion Synthesis,"Kulkarni, Nilesh, Rempe, Davis, Genova, Kyle, Kundu, Abhijit, Johnson, Justin, Fouhey, David, Guibas, Leonidas",We address the problem of generating realistic 3D motions of humans interacting with objects in a scene. Our key idea is to create a neural interaction field attached to a specific object which outputs the distance to the valid interaction manifold given a human pose as input. This interaction field guides the sampling of an object-conditioned human motion diffusion model so as to encourage plausible contacts and affordance semantics. To support interactions with scarcely available data we propose an automated synthetic data pipeline. For this we seed a pre-trained motion model which has priors for the basics of human movement with interaction-specific anchor poses extracted from limited motion capture data. Using our guided diffusion model trained on generated synthetic data we synthesize realistic motions for sitting and lifting with several objects outperforming alternative approaches in terms of motion quality and successful action completion. We call our framework NIFTY: Neural Interaction Fields for Trajectory sYnthesis.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kulkarni_NIFTY_Neural_Object_Interaction_Fields_for_Guided_Human_Motion_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Can Language Beat Numerical Regression? Language-Based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction,"Bae, Inhwan, Lee, Junoh, Jeon, Hae-Gon",Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language foundation models in this paper we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal Trajectory predictor) which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression models which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts. Here we propose a beam-search-based most-likely prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj we show that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods. Extensive experiments show that our LMTraj can successfully understand social relationships and accurately extrapolate the multimodal futures on the public pedestrian trajectory prediction benchmark.

Building Optimal Neural Architectures using Interpretable Knowledge,"Mills, Keith G., Han, Fred X., Salameh, Mohammad, Lu, Shengyao, Zhou, Chunhua, He, Jiao, Sun, Fengyu, Niu, Di",Neural Architecture Search is a costly practice. The fact that a search space can span a vast number of design choices with each architecture evaluation taking nontrivial overhead makes it hard for an algorithm to sufficiently explore candidate networks. In this paper we propose AutoBuild a scheme which learns to align the latent embeddings of operations and architecture modules with the ground-truth performance of the architectures they appear in. By doing so AutoBuild is capable of assigning interpretable importance scores to architecture modules such as individual operation features and larger macro operation sequences such that high-performance neural networks can be constructed without any need for search. Through experiments performed on state-of-the-art image classification segmentation and Stable Diffusion models we show that by mining a relatively small set of evaluated architectures AutoBuild can learn to build high-quality architectures directly or help to reduce search space to focus on relevant areas finding better architectures that outperform both the original labeled ones and ones found by search baselines.

Holo-Relighting: Controllable Volumetric Portrait Relighting from a Single Image,"Mei, Yiqun, Zeng, Yu, Zhang, He, Shu, Zhixin, Zhang, Xuaner, Bi, Sai, Zhang, Jianming, Jung, HyunJoon, Patel, Vishal M.",At the core of portrait photography is the search for ideal lighting and viewpoint. The process often requires advanced knowledge in photography and an elaborate studio setup. In this work we propose Holo-Relighting a volumetric relighting method that is capable of synthesizing novel viewpoints and novel lighting from a single image. Holo-Relighting leverages the pretrained 3D GAN (EG3D) to reconstruct geometry and appearance from an input portrait as a set of 3D-aware features. We design a relighting module conditioned on a given lighting to process these features and predict a relit 3D representation in the form of a tri-plane which can render to an arbitrary viewpoint through volume rendering. Besides viewpoint and lighting control Holo-Relighting also takes the head pose as a condition to enable head-pose-dependent lighting effects. With these novel designs Holo-Relighting can generate complex non-Lambertian lighting effects (e.g. specular highlights and cast shadows) without using any explicit physical lighting priors. We train Holo-Relighting with data captured with a light stage and propose two data-rendering techniques to improve the data quality for training the volumetric relighting system. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments we demonstrate Holo-Relighting can achieve state-of-the-arts relighting quality with better photorealism 3D consistency and controllability.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mei_Holo-Relighting_Controllable_Volumetric_Portrait_Relighting_from_a_Single_Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Noisy One-point Homographies are Surprisingly Good,"Ding, Yaqing, Astermark, Jonathan, Oskarsson, Magnus, Larsson, Viktor",Two-view homography estimation is a classic and fundamental problem in computer vision. While conceptually simple the problem quickly becomes challenging when multiple planes are visible in the image pair. Even with correct matches each individual plane (homography) might have a very low number of inliers when comparing to the set of all correspondences. In practice this requires a large number of RANSAC iterations to generate a good model hypothesis. The current state-of-the-art methods therefore seek to reduce the sample size from four point correspondences originally by including additional information such as keypoint orientation/angles or local affine information. In this work we continue in this direction and propose a novel one-point solver that leverages different approximate constraints derived from the same auxiliary information. In experiments we obtain state-of-the-art results with execution time speed-ups on large benchmark datasets and show that it is more beneficial for the solver to be sample efficient compared to generating more accurate homographies.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ding_Noisy_One-point_Homographies_are_Surprisingly_Good_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Panacea: Panoramic and Controllable Video Generation for Autonomous Driving,"Wen, Yuqing, Zhao, Yucheng, Liu, Yingfei, Jia, Fan, Wang, Yanhui, Luo, Chong, Zhang, Chi, Wang, Tiancai, Sun, Xiaoyan, Zhang, Xiangyu",The field of autonomous driving increasingly demands high-quality annotated training data. In this paper we propose Panacea an innovative approach to generate panoramic and controllable videos in driving scenarios capable of yielding an unlimited numbers of diverse annotated samples pivotal for autonomous driving advancements. Panacea addresses two critical challenges: 'Consistency' and 'Controllability.' Consistency ensures temporal and cross-view coherence while Controllability ensures the alignment of generated content with corresponding annotations. Our approach integrates a novel 4D attention and a two-stage generation pipeline to maintain coherence supplemented by the ControlNet framework for meticulous control by the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layouts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of Panacea on the nuScenes dataset prove its effectiveness in generating high-quality multi-view driving-scene videos. This work notably propels the field of autonomous driving by effectively augmenting the training dataset used for advanced BEV perception techniques.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wen_Panacea_Panoramic_and_Controllable_Video_Generation_for_Autonomous_Driving_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DreamMatcher: Appearance Matching Self-Attention for Semantically-Consistent Text-to-Image Personalization,"Nam, Jisu, Kim, Heesu, Lee, DongJae, Jin, Siyoon, Kim, Seungryong, Chang, Seunggyu",The objective of text-to-image (T2I) personalization is to customize a diffusion model to a user-provided reference concept generating diverse images of the concept aligned with the target prompts. Conventional methods representing the reference concepts using unique text embeddings often fail to accurately mimic the appearance of the reference. To address this one solution may be explicitly conditioning the reference images into the target denoising process known as key-value replacement. However prior works are constrained to local editing since they disrupt the structure path of the pre-trained T2I model. To overcome this we propose a novel plug-in method called DreamMatcher which reformulates T2I personalization as semantic matching. Specifically DreamMatcher replaces the target values with reference values aligned by semantic matching while leaving the structure path unchanged to preserve the versatile capability of pre-trained T2I models for generating diverse structures. We also introduce a semantic-consistent masking strategy to isolate the personalized concept from irrelevant regions introduced by the target prompts. Compatible with existing T2I models DreamMatcher shows significant improvements in complex scenarios. Intensive analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Nam_DreamMatcher_Appearance_Matching_Self-Attention_for_Semantically-Consistent_Text-to-Image_Personalization_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PolarMatte: Fully Computational Ground-Truth-Quality Alpha Matte Extraction for Images and Video using Polarized Screen Matting,"Enomoto, Kenji, Rhodes, TJ, Price, Brian, Miller, Gavin",The creation of high-quality alpha mattes as ground-truth data for video matting is typically a laborious task. The trade-off between accuracy manual corrections and capture constraints often produces erroneous results or is cost prohibitive. We propose PolarMatte a fully computational alpha matte extraction method for images and video without compromise between quality and practicality. A single polarization camera is used to capture dynamic scenes backlit by an off-the-shelf LCD monitor. PolarMatte exploits the polarization channel to compute the per-pixel opacity of the target scene including the transparency of fine-details translucent objects and optical/motion blur. We leverage polarization clues to robustly detect indistinguishable pixels and extract the alpha matte value at polarized foreground reflections with a polarimetric matting Laplacian. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrate our ability to computationally extract ground-truth-quality alpha mattes without human labour.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Enomoto_PolarMatte_Fully_Computational_Ground-Truth-Quality_Alpha_Matte_Extraction_for_Images_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HOIDiffusion: Generating Realistic 3D Hand-Object Interaction Data,"Zhang, Mengqi, Fu, Yang, Ding, Zheng, Liu, Sifei, Tu, Zhuowen, Wang, Xiaolong",3D hand-object interaction data is scarce due to the hardware constraints in scaling up the data collection process. In this paper we propose HOIDiffusion for generating realistic and diverse 3D hand-object interaction data. Our model is a conditional diffusion model that takes both the 3D hand-object geometric structure and text description as inputs for image synthesis. This offers a more controllable and realistic synthesis as we can specify the structure and style inputs in a disentangled manner. HOIDiffusion is trained by leveraging a diffusion model pre-trained on large-scale natural images and a few 3D human demonstrations. Beyond controllable image synthesis we adopt the generated 3D data for learning 6D object pose estimation and show its effectiveness in improving perception systems.

VecFusion: Vector Font Generation with Diffusion,"Thamizharasan, Vikas, Liu, Difan, Agarwal, Shantanu, Fisher, Matthew, Gharbi, Michael, Wang, Oliver, Jacobson, Alec, Kalogerakis, Evangelos",We present VecFusion a new neural architecture that can generate vector fonts with varying topological structures and precise control point positions. Our approach is a cascaded diffusion model which consists of a raster diffusion model followed by a vector diffusion model. The raster model generates low-resolution rasterized fonts with auxiliary control point information capturing the global style and shape of the font while the vector model synthesizes vector fonts conditioned on the low-resolution raster fonts from the first stage. To synthesize long and complex curves our vector diffusion model uses a transformer architecture and a novel vector representation that enables the modeling of diverse vector geometry and the precise prediction of control points. Our experiments show that in contrast to previous generative models for vector graphics our new cascaded vector diffusion model generates higher quality vector fonts with complex structures and diverse styles.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Thamizharasan_VecFusion_Vector_Font_Generation_with_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Towards Text-guided 3D Scene Composition,"Zhang, Qihang, Wang, Chaoyang, Siarohin, Aliaksandr, Zhuang, Peiye, Xu, Yinghao, Yang, Ceyuan, Lin, Dahua, Zhou, Bolei, Tulyakov, Sergey, Lee, Hsin-Ying",We are witnessing significant breakthroughs in the technology for generating 3D objects from text. Existing approaches either leverage large text-to-image models to optimize a 3D representation or train 3D generators on object-centric datasets. Generating entire scenes however remains very challenging as a scene contains multiple 3D objects diverse and scattered. In this work we introduce SceneWiz3D - a novel approach to synthesize high-fidelity 3D scenes from text. We marry the locality of objects with globality of scenes by introducing a hybrid 3D representation - explicit for objects and implicit for scenes. Remarkably an object being represented explicitly can be either generated from text using conventional text-to-3D approaches or provided by users. To configure the layout of the scene and automatically place objects we apply the Particle Swarm Optimization technique during the optimization process. Furthermore it is difficult for certain parts of the scene (e.g. corners occlusion) to receive multi-view supervision leading to inferior geometry. We incorporate an RGBD panorama diffusion model to mitigate it resulting in high-quality geometry. Extensive evaluation supports that our approach achieves superior quality over previous approaches enabling the generation of detailed and view-consistent 3D scenes.

EMAGE: Towards Unified Holistic Co-Speech Gesture Generation via Expressive Masked Audio Gesture Modeling,"Liu, Haiyang, Zhu, Zihao, Becherini, Giorgio, Peng, Yichen, Su, Mingyang, Zhou, You, Zhe, Xuefei, Iwamoto, Naoya, Zheng, Bo, Black, Michael J.",We propose EMAGE a framework to generate full-body human gestures from audio and masked gestures encompassing facial local body hands and global movements. To achieve this we first introduce BEAT2 (BEAT-SMPLX-FLAME) a new mesh-level holistic co-speech dataset. BEAT2 combines a MoShed SMPL-X body with FLAME head parameters and further refines the modeling of head neck and finger movements offering a community-standardized high-quality 3D motion captured dataset. EMAGE leverages masked body gesture priors during training to boost inference performance. It involves a Masked Audio Gesture Transformer facilitating joint training on audio-to-gesture generation and masked gesture reconstruction to effectively encode audio and body gesture hints. Encoded body hints from masked gestures are then separately employed to generate facial and body movements. Moreover EMAGE adaptively merges speech features from the audio's rhythm and content and utilizes four compositional VQ-VAEs to enhance the results' fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that EMAGE generates holistic gestures with state-of-the-art performance and is flexible in accepting predefined spatial-temporal gesture inputs generating complete audio-synchronized results. Our code and dataset are available. https://pantomatrix.github.io/EMAGE/,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_EMAGE_Towards_Unified_Holistic_Co-Speech_Gesture_Generation_via_Expressive_Masked_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Adversarial Text to Continuous Image Generation,"Haydarov, Kilichbek, Muhamed, Aashiq, Shen, Xiaoqian, Lazarevic, Jovana, Skorokhodov, Ivan, Galappaththige, Chamuditha Jayanga, Elhoseiny, Mohamed",Existing GAN-based text-to-image models treat images as 2D pixel arrays. In this paper we approach the text-to-image task from a different perspective where a 2D image is represented as an implicit neural representation (INR). We show that straightforward conditioning of the unconditional INR-based GAN method on text inputs is not enough to achieve good performance. We propose a word-level attention-based weight modulation operator that controls the generation process of INR-GAN based on hypernetworks. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show that HyperCGAN achieves competitive performance to existing pixel-based methods and retains the properties of continuous generative models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Haydarov_Adversarial_Text_to_Continuous_Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HumanNeRF-SE: A Simple yet Effective Approach to Animate HumanNeRF with Diverse Poses,"Ma, Caoyuan, Liu, Yu-Lun, Wang, Zhixiang, Liu, Wu, Liu, Xinchen, Wang, Zheng",We present HumanNeRF-SE a simple yet effective method that synthesizes diverse novel pose images with simple input. Previous HumanNeRF works require a large number of optimizable parameters to fit the human images. Instead we reload these approaches by combining explicit and implicit human representations to design both generalized rigid deformation and specific non-rigid deformation. Our key insight is that explicit shape can reduce the sampling points used to fit implicit representation and frozen blending weights from SMPL constructing a generalized rigid deformation can effectively avoid overfitting and improve pose generalization performance. Our architecture involving both explicit and implicit representation is simple yet effective. Experiments demonstrate our model can synthesize images under arbitrary poses with few-shot input and increase the speed of synthesizing images by 15 times through a reduction in computational complexity without using any existing acceleration modules. Compared to the state-of-the-art HumanNeRF studies HumanNeRF-SE achieves better performance with fewer learnable parameters and less training time.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ma_HumanNeRF-SE_A_Simple_yet_Effective_Approach_to_Animate_HumanNeRF_with_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HOLD: Category-agnostic 3D Reconstruction of Interacting Hands and Objects from Video,"Fan, Zicong, Parelli, Maria, Kadoglou, Maria Eleni, Chen, Xu, Kocabas, Muhammed, Black, Michael J., Hilliges, Otmar",Since humans interact with diverse objects every day the holistic 3D capture of these interactions is important to understand and model human behaviour. However most existing methods for hand-object reconstruction from RGB either assume pre-scanned object templates or heavily rely on limited 3D hand-object data restricting their ability to scale and generalize to more unconstrained interaction settings. To address this we introduce HOLD -- the first category-agnostic method that reconstructs an articulated hand and an object jointly from a monocular interaction video. We develop a compositional articulated implicit model that can reconstruct disentangled 3D hands and objects from 2D images. We also further incorporate hand-object constraints to improve hand-object poses and consequently the reconstruction quality. Our method does not rely on any 3D hand-object annotations while significantly outperforming fully-supervised baselines in both in-the-lab and challenging in-the-wild settings. Moreover we qualitatively show its robustness in reconstructing from in-the-wild videos. See https://github.com/zc-alexfan/hold for code data models and updates.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Fan_HOLD_Category-agnostic_3D_Reconstruction_of_Interacting_Hands_and_Objects_from_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Continual Segmentation with Disentangled Objectness Learning and Class Recognition,"Gong, Yizheng, Yu, Siyue, Wang, Xiaoyang, Xiao, Jimin",Most continual segmentation methods tackle the problem as a per-pixel classification task. However such a paradigm is very challenging and we find query-based segmenters with built-in objectness have inherent advantages compared with per-pixel ones as objectness has strong transfer ability and forgetting resistance. Based on these findings we propose CoMasTRe by disentangling continual segmentation into two stages: forgetting-resistant continual objectness learning and well-researched continual classification. CoMasTRe uses a two-stage segmenter learning class-agnostic mask proposals at the first stage and leaving recognition to the second stage. During continual learning a simple but effective distillation is adopted to strengthen objectness. To further mitigate the forgetting of old classes we design a multi-label class distillation strategy suited for segmentation. We assess the effectiveness of CoMasTRe on PASCAL VOC and ADE20K. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms per-pixel and query-based methods on both datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/jordangong/CoMasTRe.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Gong_Continual_Segmentation_with_Disentangled_Objectness_Learning_and_Class_Recognition_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ASAM: Boosting Segment Anything Model with Adversarial Tuning,"Li, Bo, Xiao, Haoke, Tang, Lv",In the evolving landscape of computer vision foundation models have emerged as pivotal tools exhibiting exceptional adaptability to a myriad of tasks. Among these the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by Meta AI has distinguished itself in image segmentation. However SAM like its counterparts encounters limitations in specific niche applications prompting a quest for enhancement strategies that do not compromise its inherent capabilities. This paper introduces ASAM a novel methodology that amplifies SAM's performance through adversarial tuning. We harness the potential of natural adversarial examples inspired by their successful implementation in natural language processing. By utilizing a stable diffusion model we augment a subset (1%) of the SA-1B dataset generating adversarial instances that are more representative of natural variations rather than conventional imperceptible perturbations. Our approach maintains the photorealism of adversarial examples and ensures alignment with original mask annotations thereby preserving the integrity of the segmentation task. The fine-tuned ASAM demonstrates significant improvements across a diverse range of segmentation tasks without necessitating additional data or architectural modifications. The results of our extensive evaluations confirm that ASAM establishes new benchmarks in segmentation tasks thereby contributing to the advancement of foundational models in computer vision.

Dynamic Support Information Mining for Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation,"Ren, Pengfei, Gao, Yuanyuan, Sun, Haifeng, Qi, Qi, Wang, Jingyu, Liao, Jianxin",Category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) aims to predict the pose of a query image based on few support images with pose annotations. Existing methods achieve the localization of arbitrary keypoints through similarity matching between support keypoint features and query image features. However these methods primarily focus on mining information from the query images neglecting the fact that support samples with keypoint annotations contain rich category-specific fine-grained semantic information and prior structural information. In this paper we propose a Support-based Dynamic Perception Network (SDPNet) for the robust and accurate CAPE. On the one hand SDPNet models complex dependencies between support keypoints constructing category-specific prior structure to guide the interaction of query keypoints. On the other hand SDPNet extracts fine-grained semantic information from support samples dynamically modulating the refinement process of query. Our method outperforms existing methods on MP-100 dataset by a large margin.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ren_Dynamic_Support_Information_Mining_for_Category-Agnostic_Pose_Estimation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Taming Mode Collapse in Score Distillation for Text-to-3D Generation,"Wang, Peihao, Xu, Dejia, Fan, Zhiwen, Wang, Dilin, Mohan, Sreyas, Iandola, Forrest, Ranjan, Rakesh, Li, Yilei, Liu, Qiang, Wang, Zhangyang, Chandra, Vikas","Despite the remarkable performance of score distillation in text-to-3D generation such techniques notoriously suffer from view inconsistency issues also known as ""Janus"" artifact where the generated objects fake each view with multiple front faces. Although empirically effective methods have approached this problem via score debiasing or prompt engineering a more rigorous perspective to explain and tackle this problem remains elusive. In this paper we reveal that the existing score distillation-based text-to-3D generation frameworks degenerate to maximal likelihood seeking on each view independently and thus suffer from the mode collapse problem manifesting as the Janus artifact in practice. To tame mode collapse we improve score distillation by re-establishing the entropy term in the corresponding variational objective which is applied to the distribution of rendered images. Maximizing the entropy encourages diversity among different views in generated 3D assets thereby mitigating the Janus problem. Based on this new objective we derive a new update rule for 3D score distillation dubbed Entropic Score Distillation (ESD). We theoretically reveal that ESD can be simplified and implemented by just adopting the classifier-free guidance trick upon variational score distillation. Although embarrassingly straightforward our extensive experiments demonstrate that ESD can be an effective treatment for Janus artifacts in score distillation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Taming_Mode_Collapse_in_Score_Distillation_for_Text-to-3D_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MagicAnimate: Temporally Consistent Human Image Animation using Diffusion Model,"Xu, Zhongcong, Zhang, Jianfeng, Liew, Jun Hao, Yan, Hanshu, Liu, Jia-Wei, Zhang, Chenxu, Feng, Jiashi, Shou, Mike Zheng",This paper studies the human image animation task which aims to generate a video of a certain reference identity following a particular motion sequence. Existing animation works typically employ the frame-warping technique to animate the reference image towards the target motion. Despite achieving reasonable results these approaches face challenges in maintaining temporal consistency throughout the animation due to the lack of temporal modeling and poor preservation of reference identity. In this work we introduce MagicAnimate a diffusion-based framework that aims at enhancing temporal consistency preserving reference image faithfully and improving animation fidelity. To achieve this we first develop a video diffusion model to encode temporal information. Second to maintain the appearance coherence across frames we introduce a novel appearance encoder to retain the intricate details of the reference image. Leveraging these two innovations we further employ a simple video fusion technique to encourage smooth transitions for long video animation. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our method over baseline approaches on two benchmarks. Notably our approach outperforms the strongest baseline by over 38% in terms of video fidelity on the challenging TikTok dancing dataset.

From Correspondences to Pose: Non-minimal Certifiably Optimal Relative Pose without Disambiguation,"Tirado-Gar√≠n, Javier, Civera, Javier",Estimating the relative camera pose from n \geq 5 correspondences between two calibrated views is a fundamental task in computer vision. This process typically involves two stages: 1) estimating the essential matrix between the views and 2) disambiguating among the four candidate relative poses that satisfy the epipolar geometry. In this paper we demonstrate a novel approach that for the first time bypasses the second stage. Specifically we show that it is possible to directly estimate the correct relative camera pose from correspondences without needing a post-processing step to enforce the cheirality constraint on the correspondences. Building on recent advances in certifiable non-minimal optimization we frame the relative pose estimation as a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP). By applying the appropriate constraints we ensure the estimation of a camera pose that corresponds to a valid 3D geometry and that is globally optimal when certified. We validate our method through exhaustive synthetic and real-world experiments confirming the efficacy efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach.

Loose Inertial Poser: Motion Capture with IMU-attached Loose-Wear Jacket,"Zuo, Chengxu, Wang, Yiming, Zhan, Lishuang, Guo, Shihui, Yi, Xinyu, Xu, Feng, Qin, Yipeng",Existing wearable motion capture methods typically demand tight on-body fixation (often using straps) for reliable sensing limiting their application in everyday life. In this paper we introduce Loose Inertial Poser a novel motion capture solution with high wearing comfortableness by integrating four Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) into a loose-wear jacket. Specifically we address the challenge of scarce loose-wear IMU training data by proposing a Secondary Motion AutoEncoder (SeMo-AE) that learns to model and synthesize the effects of secondary motion between the skin and loose clothing on IMU data. SeMo-AE is leveraged to generate a diverse synthetic dataset of loose-wear IMU data to augment training for the pose estimation network and significantly improve its accuracy. For validation we collected a dataset with various subjects and 2 wearing styles (zipped and unzipped). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains high-quality real-time posture estimation even in loose-wear scenarios.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zuo_Loose_Inertial_Poser_Motion_Capture_with_IMU-attached_Loose-Wear_Jacket_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Training-Free Pretrained Model Merging,"Xu, Zhengqi, Yuan, Ke, Wang, Huiqiong, Wang, Yong, Song, Mingli, Song, Jie",Recently model merging techniques have surfaced as a solution to combine multiple single-talent models into a single multi-talent model. However previous endeavors in this field have either necessitated additional training or fine-tuning processes or require that the models possess the same pre-trained initialization. In this work we identify a common drawback in prior works w.r.t. the inconsistency of unit similarity in the weight space and the activation space. To address this inconsistency we propose an innovative model merging framework coined as merging under dual-space constraints (MuDSC). Specifically instead of solely maximizing the objective of a single space we advocate for the exploration of permutation matrices situated in a region with a unified high similarity in the dual space achieved through the linear combination of activation and weight similarity matrices. In order to enhance usability we have also incorporated adaptations for group structure including Multi-Head Attention and Group Normalization. Comprehensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that MuDSC can significantly boost the performance of merged models with various task combinations and architectures. Furthermore the visualization of the merged model within the multi-task loss landscape reveals that MuDSC enables the merged model to reside in the overlapping segment featuring a unified lower loss for each task. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zju-vipa/training_free_model_merging.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_Training-Free_Pretrained_Model_Merging_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
NC-SDF: Enhancing Indoor Scene Reconstruction Using Neural SDFs with View-Dependent Normal Compensation,"Chen, Ziyi, Wu, Xiaolong, Zhang, Yu",State-of-the-art neural implicit surface representations have achieved impressive results in indoor scene reconstruction by incorporating monocular geometric priors as additional supervision. However we have observed that multi-view inconsistency between such priors poses a challenge for high-quality reconstructions. In response we present NC-SDF a neural signed distance field (SDF) 3D reconstruction framework with view-dependent normal compensation (NC). Specifically we integrate view-dependent biases in monocular normal priors into the neural implicit representation of the scene. By adaptively learning and correcting the biases our NC-SDF effectively mitigates the adverse impact of inconsistent supervision enhancing both the global consistency and local details in the reconstructions. To further refine the details we introduce an informative pixel sampling strategy to pay more attention to intricate geometry with higher information content. Additionally we design a hybrid geometry modeling approach to improve the neural implicit representation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NC-SDF outperforms existing approaches in terms of reconstruction quality.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_NC-SDF_Enhancing_Indoor_Scene_Reconstruction_Using_Neural_SDFs_with_View-Dependent_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Person in Place: Generating Associative Skeleton-Guidance Maps for Human-Object Interaction Image Editing,"Yang, ChangHee, Kang, ChanHee, Kong, Kyeongbo, Oh, Hanni, Kang, Suk-Ju",Recently there were remarkable advances in image editing tasks in various ways. Nevertheless existing image editing models are not designed for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) image editing. One of these approaches (e.g. ControlNet) employs the skeleton guidance to offer precise representations of human showing better results in HOI image editing. However using conventional methods manually creating HOI skeleton guidance is necessary. This paper proposes the object interactive diffuser with associative attention that considers both the interaction with objects and the joint graph structure automating the generation of HOI skeleton guidance. Additionally we propose the HOI loss with novel scaling parameter demonstrating its effectiveness in generating skeletons that interact better. To evaluate generated object-interactive skeletons we propose two metrics top-N accuracy and skeleton probabilistic distance. Our framework integrates object interactive diffuser that generates object-interactive skeletons with previous methods demonstrating the outstanding results in HOI image editing. Finally we present potentials of our framework beyond HOI image editing as applications to human-to-human interaction skeleton editing and 3D mesh optimization.

ChatPose: Chatting about 3D Human Pose,"Feng, Yao, Lin, Jing, Dwivedi, Sai Kumar, Sun, Yu, Patel, Priyanka, Black, Michael J.",We introduce ChatPose a framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and reason about 3D human poses from images or textual descriptions. Our work is motivated by the human ability to intuitively understand postures from a single image or a brief description a process that intertwines image interpretation world knowledge and an understanding of body language. Traditional human pose estimation and generation methods often operate in isolation lacking semantic understanding and reasoning abilities. ChatPose addresses these limitations by embedding SMPL poses as distinct signal tokens within a multimodal LLM enabling the direct generation of 3D body poses from both textual and visual inputs. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of multimodal LLMs ChatPose unifies classical 3D human pose and generation tasks while offering user interactions. Additionally ChatPose empowers LLMs to apply their extensive world knowledge in reasoning about human poses leading to two advanced tasks: speculative pose generation and reasoning about pose estimation. These tasks involve reasoning about humans to generate 3D poses from subtle text queries possibly accompanied by images. We establish benchmarks for these tasks moving beyond traditional 3D pose generation and estimation methods.

Distilling ODE Solvers of Diffusion Models into Smaller Steps,"Kim, Sanghwan, Tang, Hao, Yu, Fisher",Abstract Diffusion models have recently gained prominence as a novel category of generative models. Despite their success these models face a notable drawback in terms of slow sampling speeds requiring a high number of function evaluations (NFE) in the order of hundreds or thousands. In response both learning-free and learning-based sampling strategies have been explored to expedite the sampling process. Learning-free sampling employs various ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers based on the formulation of diffusion ODEs. However it encounters challenges in faithfully tracking the true sampling trajectory particularly for small NFE. Conversely learning-based sampling methods such as knowledge distillation demand extensive additional training limiting their practical applicability. To overcome these limitations we introduce Distilled-ODE solvers (D-ODE solvers) a straightforward distillation approach grounded in ODE solver formulations. Our method seamlessly integrates the strengths of both learning-free and learning-based sampling. D-ODE solvers are constructed by introducing a single parameter adjustment to existing ODE solvers. Furthermore we optimize D-ODE solvers with smaller steps using knowledge distillation from ODE solvers with larger steps across a batch of samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of D-ODE solvers compared to existing ODE solvers including DDIM PNDM DPM-Solver DEIS and EDM particularly in scenarios with fewer NFE. Notably our method incurs negligible computational overhead compared to previous distillation techniques facilitating straightforward and rapid integration with existing samplers. Qualitative analysis reveals that D-ODE solvers not only enhance image quality but also faithfully follow the target ODE trajectory.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kim_Distilling_ODE_Solvers_of_Diffusion_Models_into_Smaller_Steps_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
LightIt: Illumination Modeling and Control for Diffusion Models,"Kocsis, Peter, Philip, Julien, Sunkavalli, Kalyan, Nie√üner, Matthias, Hold-Geoffroy, Yannick",We introduce LightIt a method for explicit illumination control for image generation. Recent generative methods lack lighting control which is crucial to numerous artistic aspects of image generation such as setting the overall mood or cinematic appearance. To overcome these limitations we propose to condition the generation on shading and normal maps. We model the lighting with single bounce shading which includes cast shadows. We first train a shading estimation module to generate a dataset of real-world images and shading pairs. Then we train a control network using the estimated shading and normals as input. Our method demonstrates high-quality image generation and lighting control in numerous scenes. Additionally we use our generated dataset to train an identity-preserving relighting model conditioned on an image and a target shading. Our method is the first that enables the generation of images with controllable consistent lighting and performs on par with specialized relighting state-of-the-art methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kocsis_LightIt_Illumination_Modeling_and_Control_for_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Neural Lineage,"Yu, Runpeng, Wang, Xinchao",Given a well-behaved neural network is possible to identify its parent based on which it was tuned? In this paper we introduce a novel task known as neural lineage detection aiming at discovering lineage relationships between parent and child models. Specifically from a set of parent models neural lineage detection predicts which parent model a child model has been fine-tuned from. We propose two approaches to address this task. (1) For practical convenience we introduce a learning-free approach which integrates an approximation of the finetuning process into the neural network representation similarity metrics leading to a similarity-based lineage detection scheme. (2) For the pursuit of accuracy we introduce a learning-based lineage detector comprising encoders and a transformer detector. Through experimentation we have validated that our proposed learning-free and learning-based methods outperform the baseline in various learning settings and are adaptable to a variety of visual models. Moreover they also exhibit the ability to trace cross-generational lineage identifying not only parent models but also their ancestors.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yu_Neural_Lineage_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Visual Layout Composer: Image-Vector Dual Diffusion Model for Design Layout Generation,"Shabani, Mohammad Amin, Wang, Zhaowen, Liu, Difan, Zhao, Nanxuan, Yang, Jimei, Furukawa, Yasutaka",This paper proposes an image-vector dual diffusion model for generative layout design. Distinct from prior efforts that mostly ignore element-level visual information our approach integrates the power of a pre-trained large image diffusion model to guide layout composition in a vector diffusion model by providing enhanced salient region understanding and high-level inter-element relationship reasoning. Our proposed model simultaneously operates in two domains: it generates the overall design appearance in the image domain while optimizing the size and position of each design element in the vector domain. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on several datasets and enables new layout design applications.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shabani_Visual_Layout_Composer_Image-Vector_Dual_Diffusion_Model_for_Design_Layout_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
3D Multi-frame Fusion for Video Stabilization,"Peng, Zhan, Ye, Xinyi, Zhao, Weiyue, Liu, Tianqi, Sun, Huiqiang, Li, Baopu, Cao, Zhiguo",In this paper we present RStab a novel framework for video stabilization that integrates 3D multi-frame fusion through volume rendering. Departing from conventional methods we introduce a 3D multi-frame perspective to generate stabilized images addressing the challenge of full-frame generation while preserving structure. The core of our RStab framework lies in Stabilized Rendering (SR) a volume rendering module fusing multi-frame information in 3D space. Specifically SR involves warping features and colors from multiple frames by projection fusing them into descriptors to render the stabilized image. However the precision of warped information depends on the projection accuracy a factor significantly influenced by dynamic regions. In response we introduce the Adaptive Ray Range (ARR) module to integrate depth priors adaptively defining the sampling range for the projection process. Additionally we propose Color Correction (CC) assisting geometric constraints with optical flow for accurate color aggregation. Thanks to the three modules our RStab demonstrates superior performance compared with previous stabilizers in the field of view (FOV) image quality and video stability across various datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Peng_3D_Multi-frame_Fusion_for_Video_Stabilization_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Local-consistent Transformation Learning for Rotation-invariant Point Cloud Analysis,"Chen, Yiyang, Duan, Lunhao, Zhao, Shanshan, Ding, Changxing, Tao, Dacheng",Rotation invariance is an important requirement for point shape analysis. To achieve this current state-of-the-art methods attempt to construct the local rotation-invariant representation through learning or defining the local reference frame (LRF). Although efficient these LRF-based methods suffer from perturbation of local geometric relations resulting in suboptimal local rotation invariance. To alleviate this issue we propose a Local-consistent Transformation (LocoTrans) learning strategy. Specifically we first construct the local-consistent reference frame (LCRF) by considering the symmetry of the two axes in LRF. In comparison with previous LRFs our LCRF is able to preserve local geometric relationships better through performing local-consistent transformation. However as the consistency only exists in local regions the relative pose information is still lost in the intermediate layers of the network. We mitigate such a relative pose issue by developing a relative pose recovery (RPR) module. RPR aims to restore the relative pose between adjacent transformed patches. Equipped with LCRF and RPR our LocoTrans is capable of learning local-consistent transformation and preserving local geometry which benefits rotation invariance learning. Competitive performance under arbitrary rotations on both shape classification and part segmentation tasks and ablations can demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code will be available publicly at https://github.com/wdttt/LocoTrans.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Local-consistent_Transformation_Learning_for_Rotation-invariant_Point_Cloud_Analysis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Tailored Visions: Enhancing Text-to-Image Generation with Personalized Prompt Rewriting,"Chen, Zijie, Zhang, Lichao, Weng, Fangsheng, Pan, Lili, Lan, Zhenzhong",Despite significant progress in the field it is still challenging to create personalized visual representations that align closely with the desires and preferences of individual users. This process requires users to articulate their ideas in words that are both comprehensible to the models and accurately capture their vision posing difficulties for many users. In this paper we tackle this challenge by leveraging historical user interactions with the system to enhance user prompts. We propose a novel approach that involves rewriting user prompts based on a newly collected large-scale text-to-image dataset with over 300k prompts from 3115 users. Our rewriting model enhances the expressiveness and alignment of user prompts with their intended visual outputs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods over baseline approaches as evidenced in our new offline evaluation method and online tests. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zzjchen/Tailored-Visions,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Tailored_Visions_Enhancing_Text-to-Image_Generation_with_Personalized_Prompt_Rewriting_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Efficient Deformable ConvNets: Rethinking Dynamic and Sparse Operator for Vision Applications,"Xiong, Yuwen, Li, Zhiqi, Chen, Yuntao, Wang, Feng, Zhu, Xizhou, Luo, Jiapeng, Wang, Wenhai, Lu, Tong, Li, Hongsheng, Qiao, Yu, Lu, Lewei, Zhou, Jie, Dai, Jifeng",We introduce Deformable Convolution v4 (DCNv4) a highly efficient and effective operator designed for a broad spectrum of vision applications. DCNv4 addresses the limitations of its predecessor DCNv3 with two key enhancements: 1. removing softmax normalization in spatial aggregation to enhance its dynamic property and expressive power and 2. optimizing memory access to minimize redundant operations for speedup. These improvements result in a significantly faster convergence compared to DCNv3 and a substantial increase in processing speed with DCNv4 achieving more than three times the forward speed. DCNv4 demonstrates exceptional performance across various tasks including image classification instance and semantic segmentation and notably image generation. When integrated into generative models like U-Net in the latent diffusion model DCNv4 outperforms its baseline underscoring its possibility to enhance generative models. In practical applications replacing DCNv3 with DCNv4 in the InternImage model to create FlashInternImage results in up to 80% speed increase and further performance improvement without further modifications. The advancements in speed and efficiency of DCNv4 combined with its robust performance across diverse vision tasks show its potential as a foundational building block for future vision models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xiong_Efficient_Deformable_ConvNets_Rethinking_Dynamic_and_Sparse_Operator_for_Vision_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CoDe: An Explicit Content Decoupling Framework for Image Restoration,"Gu, Enxuan, Ge, Hongwei, Guo, Yong",The performance of image restoration (IR) is highly dependent on the reconstruction quality of diverse contents with varying complexity. However most IR approaches model the mapping between various complexity contents of inputs and outputs through the repeated feature calculation propagation mechanism in a unified pipeline which leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue we propose an explicit Content Decoupling framework for IR dubbed CoDe to end-to-end model the restoration process by utilizing decoupled content components in a divide-and-conquer-like architecture. Specifically a Content Decoupling Module is first designed to decouple content components of inputs and outputs according to the frequency spectra adaptively generated from the transform domain. In addition in order to harness the divide-and-conquer strategy for reconstructing decoupled content components we propose an IR Network Container. It contains an optimized version which is a streamlining of an arbitrary IR network comprising the cascaded modulated subnets and a Reconstruction Layers Pool. Finally a Content Consistency Loss is designed from the transform domain perspective to supervise the restoration process of each content component and further guide the feature fusion process. Extensive experiments on several IR tasks such as image super-resolution image denoising and image blurring covering both real and synthetic settings demonstrate that the proposed paradigm can effectively take the performance of the original network to a new state-of-the-art level in multiple benchmark datasets (e.g. 0.34dB@Set5 x4 over DAT).,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Gu_CoDe_An_Explicit_Content_Decoupling_Framework_for_Image_Restoration_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DreamVideo: Composing Your Dream Videos with Customized Subject and Motion,"Wei, Yujie, Zhang, Shiwei, Qing, Zhiwu, Yuan, Hangjie, Liu, Zhiheng, Liu, Yu, Zhang, Yingya, Zhou, Jingren, Shan, Hongming",Customized generation using diffusion models has made impressive progress in image generation but remains unsatisfactory in the challenging video generation task as it requires the controllability of both subjects and motions. To that end we present DreamVideo a novel approach to generating personalized videos from a few static images of the desired subject and a few videos of target motion. DreamVideo decouples this task into two stages subject learning and motion learning by leveraging a pre-trained video diffusion model. The subject learning aims to accurately capture the fine appearance of the subject from provided images which is achieved by combining textual inversion and fine-tuning of our carefully designed identity adapter. In motion learning we architect a motion adapter and fine-tune it on the given videos to effectively model the target motion pattern. Combining these two lightweight and efficient adapters allows for flexible customization of any subject with any motion. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our DreamVideo over the state-of-the-art methods for customized video generation.

Using Human Feedback to Fine-tune Diffusion Models without Any Reward Model,"Yang, Kai, Tao, Jian, Lyu, Jiafei, Ge, Chunjiang, Chen, Jiaxin, Shen, Weihan, Zhu, Xiaolong, Li, Xiu",Using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has shown significant promise in fine-tuning diffusion models. Previous methods start by training a reward model that aligns with human preferences then leverage RL techniques to fine-tune the underlying models. However crafting an efficient reward model demands extensive datasets optimal architecture and manual hyperparameter tuning making the process both time and cost-intensive. The direct preference optimization (DPO) method effective in fine-tuning large language models eliminates the necessity for a reward model. However the extensive GPU memory requirement of the diffusion model's denoising process hinders the direct application of the DPO method. To address this issue we introduce the Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method to directly fine-tune diffusion models. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that although D3PO omits training a reward model it effectively functions as the optimal reward model trained using human feedback data to guide the learning process. This approach requires no training of a reward model proving to be more direct cost-effective and minimizing computational overhead. In experiments our method uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference delivering comparable results to methods using ground-truth rewards. Moreover D3PO demonstrates the ability to reduce image distortion rates and generate safer images overcoming challenges lacking robust reward models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yk7333/D3PO.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yang_Using_Human_Feedback_to_Fine-tune_Diffusion_Models_without_Any_Reward_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SynSP: Synergy of Smoothness and Precision in Pose Sequences Refinement,"Wang, Tao, Jin, Lei, Wang, Zheng, Li, Jianshu, Li, Liang, Zhao, Fang, Cheng, Yu, Yuan, Li, Zhou, Li, Xing, Junliang, Zhao, Jian",Predicting human pose sequences via existing pose estimators often encounters various estimation errors. Motion refinement methods aim to optimize the predicted human pose sequences from pose estimators while ensuring minimal computational overhead and latency. Prior investigations have primarily concentrated on striking a balance between the two objectives i.e. smoothness and precision while optimizing the predicted pose sequences. However it has come to our attention that the tension between these two objectives can provide additional quality cues about the predicted pose sequences. These cues in turn are able to aid the network in optimizing lower-quality poses. To leverage this quality information we propose a motion refinement network termed SynSP to achieve a Synergy of Smoothness and Precision in the sequence refinement tasks. Moreover SynSP can also address multi-view poses of one person simultaneously fixing inaccuracies in predicted poses through heightened attention to similar poses from other views thereby amplifying the resultant quality cues and overall performance. Compared with previous methods SynSP benefits from both pose quality and multi-view information with a much shorter input sequence length achieving state-of-the-art results among four challenging datasets involving 2D 3D and SMPL pose representations in both single-view and multi-view scenes.

Learned Representation-Guided Diffusion Models for Large-Image Generation,"Graikos, Alexandros, Yellapragada, Srikar, Le, Minh-Quan, Kapse, Saarthak, Prasanna, Prateek, Saltz, Joel, Samaras, Dimitris",To synthesize high-fidelity samples diffusion models typically require auxiliary data to guide the generation process. However it is impractical to procure the painstaking patch-level annotation effort required in specialized domains like histopathology and satellite imagery; it is often performed by domain experts and involves hundreds of millions of patches. Modern-day self-supervised learning (SSL) representations encode rich semantic and visual information. In this paper we posit that such representations are expressive enough to act as proxies to fine-grained human labels. We introduce a novel approach that trains diffusion models conditioned on embeddings from SSL. Our diffusion models successfully project these features back to high-quality histopathology and remote sensing images. In addition we construct larger images by assembling spatially consistent patches inferred from SSL embeddings preserving long-range dependencies. Augmenting real data by generating variations of real images improves downstream classifier accuracy for patch-level and larger image-scale classification tasks. Our models are effective even on datasets not encountered during training demonstrating their robustness and generalizability. Generating images from learned embeddings is agnostic to the source of the embeddings. The SSL embeddings used to generate a large image can either be extracted from a reference image or sampled from an auxiliary model conditioned on any related modality (e.g. class labels text genomic data). As proof of concept we introduce the text-to-large image synthesis paradigm where we successfully synthesize large pathology and satellite images out of text descriptions.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Graikos_Learned_Representation-Guided_Diffusion_Models_for_Large-Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Ranni: Taming Text-to-Image Diffusion for Accurate Instruction Following,"Feng, Yutong, Gong, Biao, Chen, Di, Shen, Yujun, Liu, Yu, Zhou, Jingren",Existing text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models usually struggle in interpreting complex prompts especially those with quantity object-attribute binding and multi-subject descriptions. In this work we introduce a semantic panel as the middleware in decoding texts to images supporting the generator to better follow instructions. The panel is obtained through arranging the visual concepts parsed from the input text by the aid of large language models and then injected into the denoising network as a detailed control signal to complement the text condition. To facilitate text-to-panel learning we come up with a carefully designed semantic formatting protocol accompanied by a fully-automatic data preparation pipeline. Thanks to such a design our approach which we call Ranni manages to enhance a pre-trained T2I generator regarding its textual controllability. More importantly the introduction of the generative middleware brings a more convenient form of interaction (i.e. directly adjusting the elements in the panel or using language instructions) and further allows users to finely customize their generation based on which we develop a practical system and showcase its potential in continuous generation and chatting-based editing.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Feng_Ranni_Taming_Text-to-Image_Diffusion_for_Accurate_Instruction_Following_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Direct2.5: Diverse Text-to-3D Generation via Multi-view 2.5D Diffusion,"Lu, Yuanxun, Zhang, Jingyang, Li, Shiwei, Fang, Tian, McKinnon, David, Tsin, Yanghai, Quan, Long, Cao, Xun, Yao, Yao",Recent advances in generative AI have unveiled significant potential for the creation of 3D content. However current methods either apply a pre-trained 2D diffusion model with the time-consuming score distillation sampling (SDS) or a direct 3D diffusion model trained on limited 3D data losing generation diversity. In this work we approach the problem by employing a multi-view 2.5D diffusion fine-tuned from a pre-trained 2D diffusion model. The multi-view 2.5D diffusion directly models the structural distribution of 3D data while still maintaining the strong generalization ability of the original 2D diffusion model filling the gap between 2D diffusion-based and direct 3D diffusion-based methods for 3D content generation. During inference multi-view normal maps are generated using the 2.5D diffusion and a novel differentiable rasterization scheme is introduced to fuse the almost consistent multi-view normal maps into a consistent 3D model. We further design a normal-conditioned multi-view image generation module for fast appearance generation given the 3D geometry. Our method is a one-pass diffusion process and does not require any SDS optimization as post-processing. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our direct 2.5D generation with the specially-designed fusion scheme can achieve diverse mode-seeking-free and high-fidelity 3D content generation in only 10 seconds.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lu_Direct2.5_Diverse_Text-to-3D_Generation_via_Multi-view_2.5D_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MatFuse: Controllable Material Generation with Diffusion Models,"Vecchio, Giuseppe, Sortino, Renato, Palazzo, Simone, Spampinato, Concetto",Creating high-quality materials in computer graphics is a challenging and time-consuming task which requires great expertise. To simplify this process we introduce MatFuse a unified approach that harnesses the generative power of diffusion models for creation and editing of 3D materials. Our method integrates multiple sources of conditioning including color palettes sketches text and pictures enhancing creative possibilities and granting fine-grained control over material synthesis. Additionally MatFuse enables map-level material editing capabilities through latent manipulation by means of a multi-encoder compression model which learns a disentangled latent representation for each map. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MatFuse under multiple conditioning settings and explore the potential of material editing. Finally we assess the quality of the generated materials both quantitatively in terms of CLIP-IQA and FID scores and qualitatively by conducting a user study. Source code for training MatFuse and supplemental materials are publicly available at https://gvecchio.com/matfuse.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Vecchio_MatFuse_Controllable_Material_Generation_with_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Training Vision Transformers for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Hu, Xinting, Jiang, Li, Schiele, Bernt",We present S4Former a novel approach to training Vision Transformers for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (S4). At its core S4Former employs a Vision Transformer within a classic teacher-student framework and then leverages three novel technical ingredients: PatchShuffle as a parameter-free perturbation technique Patch-Adaptive Self-Attention (PASA) as a fine-grained feature modulation method and the innovative Negative Class Ranking (NCR) regularization loss. Based on these regularization modules aligned with Transformer-specific characteristics across the image input feature and output dimensions S4Former exploits the Transformer's ability to capture and differentiate consistent global contextual information in unlabeled images. Overall S4Former not only defines a new state of the art in S4 but also maintains a streamlined and scalable architecture. Being readily compatible with existing frameworks S4Former achieves strong improvements (up to 4.9%) on benchmarks like Pascal VOC 2012 COCO and Cityscapes with varying numbers of labeled data. The code is at https://github.com/JoyHuYY1412/S4Former.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hu_Training_Vision_Transformers_for_Semi-Supervised_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Quantifying Task Priority for Multi-Task Optimization,"Jeong, Wooseong, Yoon, Kuk-Jin",The goal of multi-task learning is to learn diverse tasks within a single unified network. As each task has its own unique objective function conflicts emerge during training resulting in negative transfer among them. Earlier research identified these conflicting gradients in shared parameters between tasks and attempted to realign them in the same direction. However we prove that such optimization strategies lead to sub-optimal Pareto solutions due to their inability to accurately determine the individual contributions of each parameter across various tasks. In this paper we propose the concept of task priority to evaluate parameter contributions across different tasks. To learn task priority we identify the type of connections related to links between parameters influenced by task-specific losses during backpropagation. The strength of connections is gauged by the magnitude of parameters to determine task priority. Based on these we present a new method named connection strength-based optimization for multi-task learning which consists of two phases. The first phase learns the task priority within the network while the second phase modifies the gradients while upholding this priority. This ultimately leads to finding new Pareto optimal solutions for multiple tasks. Through extensive experiments we show that our approach greatly enhances multi-task performance in comparison to earlier gradient manipulation methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jeong_Quantifying_Task_Priority_for_Multi-Task_Optimization_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
On the Scalability of Diffusion-based Text-to-Image Generation,"Li, Hao, Zou, Yang, Wang, Ying, Majumder, Orchid, Xie, Yusheng, Manmatha, R., Swaminathan, Ashwin, Tu, Zhuowen, Ermon, Stefano, Soatto, Stefano",Scaling up model and data size has been quite successful for the evolution of LLMs. However the scaling law for the diffusion based text-to-image (T2I) models is not fully explored. It is also unclear how to efficiently scale the model for better performance at reduced cost. The different training settings and expensive training cost make a fair model comparison extremely difficult. In this work we empirically study the scaling properties of diffusion based T2I models by performing extensive and rigours ablations on scaling both denoising backbones and training set including training scaled UNet and Transformer variants ranging from 0.4B to 4B parameters on datasets upto 600M images. For model scaling we find the location and amount of cross attention distinguishes the performance of existing UNet designs. And increasing the transformer blocks is more parameter-efficient for improving text-image alignment than increasing channel numbers. We then identify an efficient UNet variant which is 45% smaller and 28% faster than SDXL's UNet. On the data scaling side we show the quality and diversity of the training set matters more than simply dataset size. Increasing caption density and diversity improves text-image alignment performance and the learning efficiency. Finally we provide scaling functions to predict the text-image alignment performance as functions of the scale of model size compute and dataset size.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_On_the_Scalability_of_Diffusion-based_Text-to-Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AnySkill: Learning Open-Vocabulary Physical Skill for Interactive Agents,"Cui, Jieming, Liu, Tengyu, Liu, Nian, Yang, Yaodong, Zhu, Yixin, Huang, Siyuan",Traditional approaches in physics-based motion generation centered around imitation learning and reward shaping often struggle to adapt to new scenarios. To tackle this limitation we propose AnySkill a novel hierarchical method that learns physically plausible interactions following open-vocabulary instructions. Our approach begins by developing a set of atomic actions via a low-level controller trained via imitation learning. Upon receiving an open-vocabulary textual instruction AnySkill employs a high-level policy that selects and integrates these atomic actions to maximize the CLIP similarity between the agent's rendered images and the text. An important feature of our method is the use of image-based rewards for the high-level policy which allows the agent to learn interactions with objects without manual reward engineering. We demonstrate AnySkill's capability to generate realistic and natural motion sequences in response to unseen instructions of varying lengths marking it the first method capable of open-vocabulary physical skill learning for interactive humanoid agents.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cui_AnySkill_Learning_Open-Vocabulary_Physical_Skill_for_Interactive_Agents_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Generative Unlearning for Any Identity,"Seo, Juwon, Lee, Sung-Hoon, Lee, Tae-Young, Moon, Seungjun, Park, Gyeong-Moon",Recent advances in generative models trained on large-scale datasets have made it possible to synthesize high-quality samples across various domains. Moreover the emergence of strong inversion networks enables not only a reconstruction of real-world images but also the modification of attributes through various editing methods. However in certain domains related to privacy issues e.g. human faces advanced generative models along with strong inversion methods can lead to potential misuses. In this paper we propose an essential yet under-explored task called generative identity unlearning which steers the model not to generate an image of a specific identity. In the generative identity unlearning we target the following objectives: (i) preventing the generation of images with a certain identity and (ii) preserving the overall quality of the generative model. To satisfy these goals we propose a novel framework Generative Unlearning for Any Identity (GUIDE) which prevents the reconstruction of a specific identity by unlearning the generator with only a single image. GUIDE consists of two parts: (i) finding a target point for optimization that un-identifies the source latent code and (ii) novel loss functions that facilitate the unlearning procedure while less affecting the learned distribution. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the generative machine unlearning task. The code is available at https://github.com/KHU-AGI/GUIDE.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Seo_Generative_Unlearning_for_Any_Identity_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FlowVid: Taming Imperfect Optical Flows for Consistent Video-to-Video Synthesis,"Liang, Feng, Wu, Bichen, Wang, Jialiang, Yu, Licheng, Li, Kunpeng, Zhao, Yinan, Misra, Ishan, Huang, Jia-Bin, Zhang, Peizhao, Vajda, Peter, Marculescu, Diana",Diffusion models have transformed the image-to-image (I2I) synthesis and are now permeating into videos. However the advancement of video-to-video (V2V) synthesis has been hampered by the challenge of maintaining temporal consistency across video frames. This paper proposes a consistent V2V synthesis framework by jointly leveraging spatial conditions and temporal optical flow clues within the source video. Contrary to prior methods that strictly adhere to optical flow our approach harnesses its benefits while handling the imperfection in flow estimation. We encode the optical flow via warping from the first frame and serve it as a supplementary reference in the diffusion model. This enables our model for video synthesis by editing the first frame with any prevalent I2I models and then propagating edits to successive frames. Our V2V model FlowVid demonstrates remarkable properties: (1) Flexibility: FlowVid works seamlessly with existing I2I models facilitating various modifications including stylization object swaps and local edits. (2) Efficiency: Generation of a 4-second video with 30 FPS and 512x512 resolution takes only 1.5 minutes which is 3.1x 7.2x and 10.5x faster than CoDeF Rerender and TokenFlow respectively. (3) High-quality: In user studies our FlowVid is preferred 45.7% of the time outperforming CoDeF (3.5%) Rerender (10.2%) and TokenFlow (40.4%).,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liang_FlowVid_Taming_Imperfect_Optical_Flows_for_Consistent_Video-to-Video_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
StyleCineGAN: Landscape Cinemagraph Generation using a Pre-trained StyleGAN,"Choi, Jongwoo, Seo, Kwanggyoon, Ashtari, Amirsaman, Noh, Junyong",We propose a method that can generate cinemagraphs automatically from a still landscape image using a pre-trained StyleGAN. Inspired by the success of recent unconditional video generation we leverage a powerful pre-trained image generator to synthesize high-quality cinemagraphs. Unlike previous approaches that mainly utilize the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN our approach utilizes its deep feature space for both GAN inversion and cinemagraph generation. Specifically we propose multi-scale deep feature warping (MSDFW) which warps the intermediate features of a pre-trained StyleGAN at different resolutions. By using MSDFW the generated cinemagraphs are of high resolution and exhibit plausible looping animation. We demonstrate the superiority of our method through user studies and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art cinemagraph generation methods and a video generation method that uses a pre-trained StyleGAN.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Choi_StyleCineGAN_Landscape_Cinemagraph_Generation_using_a_Pre-trained_StyleGAN_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Laplacian-guided Entropy Model in Neural Codec with Blur-dissipated Synthesis,"Khoshkhahtinat, Atefeh, Zafari, Ali, Mehta, Piyush M., Nasrabadi, Nasser M.",While replacing Gaussian decoders with a conditional diffusion model enhances the perceptual quality of reconstructions in neural image compression their lack of inductive bias for image data restricts their ability to achieve state-of-the-art perceptual levels. To address this limitation we adopt a non-isotropic diffusion model at the decoder side. This model imposes an inductive bias aimed at distinguishing between frequency contents thereby facilitating the generation of high-quality images. Moreover our framework is equipped with a novel entropy model that accurately models the probability distribution of latent representation by exploiting spatio-channel correlations in latent space while accelerating the entropy decoding step. This channel-wise entropy model leverages both local and global spatial contexts within each channel chunk. The global spatial context is built upon the Transformer which is specifically designed for image compression tasks. The designed Transformer employs a Laplacian-shaped positional encoding the learnable parameters of which are adaptively adjusted for each channel cluster. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework yields better perceptual quality compared to cutting-edge generative-based codecs and the proposed entropy model contributes to notable bitrate savings. The code is available at https://github.com/Atefeh-Khoshtinat/Blur-dissipated-compression.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Khoshkhahtinat_Laplacian-guided_Entropy_Model_in_Neural_Codec_with_Blur-dissipated_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
RMT: Retentive Networks Meet Vision Transformers,"Fan, Qihang, Huang, Huaibo, Chen, Mingrui, Liu, Hongmin, He, Ran",Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained increasing attention in the computer vision community in recent years. However the core component of ViT Self-Attention lacks explicit spatial priors and bears a quadratic computational complexity thereby constraining the applicability of ViT. To alleviate these issues we draw inspiration from the recent Retentive Network (RetNet) in the field of NLP and propose RMT a strong vision backbone with explicit spatial prior for general purposes. Specifically we extend the RetNet's temporal decay mechanism to the spatial domain and propose a spatial decay matrix based on the Manhattan distance to introduce the explicit spatial prior to Self-Attention. Additionally an attention decomposition form that adeptly adapts to explicit spatial prior is proposed aiming to reduce the computational burden of modeling global information without disrupting the spatial decay matrix. Based on the spatial decay matrix and the attention decomposition form we can flexibly integrate explicit spatial prior into the vision backbone with linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMT exhibits exceptional performance across various vision tasks. Specifically without extra training data RMT achieves 84.8% and 86.1% top-1 acc on ImageNet-1k with 27M/4.5GFLOPs and 96M/18.2GFLOPs. For downstream tasks RMT achieves 54.5 box AP and 47.2 mask AP on the COCO detection task and 52.8 mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Fan_RMT_Retentive_Networks_Meet_Vision_Transformers_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Multimodal Pathway: Improve Transformers with Irrelevant Data from Other Modalities,"Zhang, Yiyuan, Ding, Xiaohan, Gong, Kaixiong, Ge, Yixiao, Shan, Ying, Yue, Xiangyu",We propose to improve transformers of a specific modality with irrelevant data from other modalities e.g. improve an ImageNet model with audio or point cloud datasets. We would like to highlight that the data samples of the target modality are irrelevant to the other modalities which distinguishes our method from other works utilizing paired (e.g. CLIP) or interleaved data of different modalities. We propose a methodology named Multimodal Pathway - given a target modality and a transformer designed for it we use an auxiliary transformer trained with data of another modality and construct pathways to connect components of the two models so that data of the target modality can be processed by both models. In this way we utilize the universal sequence-to-sequence modeling abilities of transformers obtained from two modalities. As a concrete implementation we use a modality-specific tokenizer and task-specific head as usual but utilize the transformer blocks of the auxiliary model via a proposed method named Cross-Modal Re-parameterization which exploits the auxiliary weights without any inference costs. On the image point cloud video and audio recognition tasks we observe significant and consistent performance improvements with irrelevant data from other modalities. The code and models are available at https://github.com/AILab-CVC/M2PT.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Multimodal_Pathway_Improve_Transformers_with_Irrelevant_Data_from_Other_Modalities_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FaceChain-ImagineID: Freely Crafting High-Fidelity Diverse Talking Faces from Disentangled Audio,"Xu, Chao, Liu, Yang, Xing, Jiazheng, Wang, Weida, Sun, Mingze, Dan, Jun, Huang, Tianxin, Li, Siyuan, Cheng, Zhi-Qi, Tai, Ying, Sun, Baigui",In this paper we abstract the process of people hearing speech extracting meaningful cues and creating various dynamically audio-consistent talking faces termed Listening and Imagining into the task of high-fidelity diverse talking faces generation from a single audio. Specifically it involves two critical challenges: one is to effectively decouple identity content and emotion from entangled audio and the other is to maintain intra-video diversity and inter-video consistency. To tackle the issues we first dig out the intricate relationships among facial factors and simplify the decoupling process tailoring a Progressive Audio Disentanglement for accurate facial geometry and semantics learning where each stage incorporates a customized training module responsible for a specific factor. Secondly to achieve visually diverse and audio-synchronized animation solely from input audio within a single model we introduce the Controllable Coherent Frame generation which involves the flexible integration of three trainable adapters with frozen Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to focus on maintaining facial geometry and semantics as well as texture and temporal coherence between frames. In this way we inherit high-quality diverse generation from LDMs while significantly improving their controllability at a low training cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our method in handling this paradigm. The codes will be released at https://github.com/modelscope/facechain.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_FaceChain-ImagineID_Freely_Crafting_High-Fidelity_Diverse_Talking_Faces_from_Disentangled_Audio_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SSR-Encoder: Encoding Selective Subject Representation for Subject-Driven Generation,"Zhang, Yuxuan, Song, Yiren, Liu, Jiaming, Wang, Rui, Yu, Jinpeng, Tang, Hao, Li, Huaxia, Tang, Xu, Hu, Yao, Pan, Han, Jing, Zhongliang",Recent advancements in subject-driven image generation have led to zero-shot generation yet precise selection and focus on crucial subject representations remain challenging. Addressing this we introduce the SSR-Encoder a novel architecture designed for selectively capturing any subject from single or multiple reference images. It responds to various query modalities including text and masks without necessitating test-time fine-tuning. The SSR-Encoder combines a Token-to-Patch Aligner that aligns query inputs with image patches and a Detail-Preserving Subject Encoder for extracting and preserving fine features of the subjects thereby generating subject embeddings. These embeddings used in conjunction with original text embeddings condition the generation process. Characterized by its model generalizability and efficiency the SSR-Encoder adapts to a range of custom models and control modules. Enhanced by the Embedding Consistency Regularization Loss for improved training our extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in versatile and high-quality image generation indicating its broad applicability.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_SSR-Encoder_Encoding_Selective_Subject_Representation_for_Subject-Driven_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MVIP-NeRF: Multi-view 3D Inpainting on NeRF Scenes via Diffusion Prior,"Chen, Honghua, Loy, Chen Change, Pan, Xingang",Despite the emergence of successful NeRF inpainting methods built upon explicit RGB and depth 2D inpainting supervisions these methods are inherently constrained by the capabilities of their underlying 2D inpainters. This is due to two key reasons: (i) independently inpainting constituent images results in view-inconsistent imagery and (ii) 2D inpainters struggle to ensure high-quality geometry completion and alignment with inpainted RGB images. To overcome these limitations we propose a novel approach called MVIP-NeRF that harnesses the potential of diffusion priors for NeRF inpainting addressing both appearance and geometry aspects. MVIP-NeRF performs joint inpainting across multiple views to reach a consistent solution which is achieved via an iterative optimization process based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). Apart from recovering the rendered RGB images we also extract normal maps as a geometric representation and define a normal SDS loss that motivates accurate geometry inpainting and alignment with the appearance. Additionally we formulate a multi-view SDS score function to distill generative priors simultaneously from different view images ensuring consistent visual completion when dealing with large view variations. Our experimental results show better appearance and geometry recovery than previous NeRF inpainting methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_MVIP-NeRF_Multi-view_3D_Inpainting_on_NeRF_Scenes_via_Diffusion_Prior_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
StegoGAN: Leveraging Steganography for Non-Bijective Image-to-Image Translation,"Wu, Sidi, Chen, Yizi, Mermet, Samuel, Hurni, Lorenz, Schindler, Konrad, Gonthier, Nicolas, Landrieu, Loic",Most image-to-image translation models postulate that a unique correspondence exists between the semantic classes of the source and target domains. However this assumption does not always hold in real-world scenarios due to divergent distributions different class sets and asymmetrical information representation. As conventional GANs attempt to generate images that match the distribution of the target domain they may hallucinate spurious instances of classes absent from the source domain thereby diminishing the usefulness and reliability of translated images. CycleGAN-based methods are also known to hide the mismatched information in the generated images to bypass cycle consistency objectives a process known as steganography. In response to the challenge of non-bijective image translation we introduce StegoGAN a novel model that leverages steganography to prevent spurious features in generated images. Our approach enhances the semantic consistency of the translated images without requiring additional postprocessing or supervision. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that StegoGAN outperforms existing GAN-based models across various non-bijective image-to-image translation tasks both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our code and pretrained models are accessible at https://github.com/sian-wusidi/StegoGAN.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wu_StegoGAN_Leveraging_Steganography_for_Non-Bijective_Image-to-Image_Translation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
M&M VTO: Multi-Garment Virtual Try-On and Editing,"Zhu, Luyang, Li, Yingwei, Liu, Nan, Peng, Hao, Yang, Dawei, Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, Ira","We present M&M VTO-a mix and match virtual try-on method that takes as input multiple garment images text description for garment layout and an image of a person. An example input includes: an image of a shirt an image of a pair of pants ""rolled sleeves shirt tucked in"" and an image of a person. The output is a visualization of how those garments (in the desired layout) would look like on the given person. Key contributions of our method are: 1) a single stage diffusion based model with no super resolution cascading that allows to mix and match multiple garments at 1024x512 resolution preserving and warping intricate garment details 2) architecture design (VTO UNet Diffusion Transformer) to disentangle denoising from person specific features allowing for a highly effective finetuning strategy for identity preservation (6MB model per individual vs 4GB achieved with e.g. dreambooth finetuning); solving a common identity loss problem in current virtual try-on methods 3) layout control for multiple garments via text inputs finetuned over PaLI-3 for virtual try-on task. Experimental results indicate that M&M VTO achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively as well as opens up new opportunities for virtual try-on via language-guided and multi-garment try-on.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_MM_VTO_Multi-Garment_Virtual_Try-On_and_Editing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Dynamic Inertial Poser (DynaIP): Part-Based Motion Dynamics Learning for Enhanced Human Pose Estimation with Sparse Inertial Sensors,"Zhang, Yu, Xia, Songpengcheng, Chu, Lei, Yang, Jiarui, Wu, Qi, Pei, Ling",This paper introduces a novel human pose estimation approach using sparse inertial sensors addressing the shortcomings of previous methods reliant on synthetic data. It leverages a diverse array of real inertial motion capture data from different skeleton formats to improve motion diversity and model generalization. This method features two innovative components: a pseudo-velocity regression model for dynamic motion capture with inertial sensors and a part-based model dividing the body and sensor data into three regions each focusing on their unique characteristics. The approach demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models across five public datasets notably reducing pose error by 19% on the DIP-IMU dataset thus representing a significant improvement in inertial sensor-based human pose estimation.

GraCo: Granularity-Controllable Interactive Segmentation,"Zhao, Yian, Li, Kehan, Cheng, Zesen, Qiao, Pengchong, Zheng, Xiawu, Ji, Rongrong, Liu, Chang, Yuan, Li, Chen, Jie",Interactive Segmentation (IS) segments specific objects or parts in the image according to user input. Current IS pipelines fall into two categories: single-granularity output and multi-granularity output. The latter aims to alleviate the spatial ambiguity present in the former. However the multi-granularity output pipeline suffers from limited interaction flexibility and produces redundant results. In this work we introduce Granularity-Controllable Interactive Segmentation (GraCo) a novel approach that allows precise control of prediction granularity by introducing additional parameters to input. This enhances the customization of the interactive system and eliminates redundancy while resolving ambiguity. Nevertheless the exorbitant cost of annotating multi-granularity masks and the lack of available datasets with granularity annotations make it difficult for models to acquire the necessary guidance to control output granularity. To address this problem we design an any-granularity mask generator that exploits the semantic property of the pre-trained IS model to automatically generate abundant mask-granularity pairs without requiring additional manual annotation. Based on these pairs we propose a granularity-controllable learning strategy that efficiently imparts the granularity controllability to the IS model. Extensive experiments on intricate scenarios at object and part levels demonstrate that our GraCo has significant advantages over previous methods. This highlights the potential of GraCo to be a flexible annotation tool capable of adapting to diverse segmentation scenarios.

G-HOP: Generative Hand-Object Prior for Interaction Reconstruction and Grasp Synthesis,"Ye, Yufei, Gupta, Abhinav, Kitani, Kris, Tulsiani, Shubham",We propose G-HOP a denoising diffusion based generative prior for hand-object interactions that allows modeling both the 3D object and a human hand conditioned on the object category. To learn a 3D spatial diffusion model that can capture this joint distribution we represent the human hand via a skeletal distance field to obtain a representation aligned with the (latent) signed distance field for the object. We show that this hand-object prior can then serve as a generic guidance to facilitate other tasks like reconstruction from interaction clip and human grasp synthesis. We believe that our model trained by aggregating several diverse real-world interaction datasets spanning 155 categories represents a first approach that allows jointly generating both hand and object. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the benefit of this joint prior in video-based reconstruction and human grasp synthesis outperforming current task-specific baselines.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ye_G-HOP_Generative_Hand-Object_Prior_for_Interaction_Reconstruction_and_Grasp_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Contrastive Denoising Score for Text-guided Latent Diffusion Image Editing,"Nam, Hyelin, Kwon, Gihyun, Park, Geon Yeong, Ye, Jong Chul",With the remarkable advent of text-to-image diffusion models image editing methods have become more diverse and continue to evolve. A promising recent approach in this realm is Delta Denoising Score (DDS) - an image editing technique based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) framework that leverages the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models. However relying solely on the difference between scoring functions is insufficient for preserving specific structural elements from the original image a crucial aspect of image editing. To address this here we present an embarrassingly simple yet very powerful modification of DDS called Contrastive Denoising Score (CDS) for latent diffusion models (LDM). Inspired by the similarities and differences between DDS and the contrastive learning for unpaired image-to-image translation(CUT) we introduce a straightforward approach using CUT loss within the DDS framework. Rather than employing auxiliary networks as in the original CUT approach we leverage the intermediate features of LDM specifically those from the self-attention layers which possesses rich spatial information. Our approach enables zero-shot image-to-image translation and neural radiance field (NeRF) editing achieving structural correspondence between the input and output while maintaining content controllability. Qualitative results and comparisons demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Nam_Contrastive_Denoising_Score_for_Text-guided_Latent_Diffusion_Image_Editing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Neural Point Cloud Diffusion for Disentangled 3D Shape and Appearance Generation,"Schr√∂ppel, Philipp, Wewer, Christopher, Lenssen, Jan Eric, Ilg, Eddy, Brox, Thomas",Controllable generation of 3D assets is important for many practical applications like content creation in movies games and engineering as well as in AR/VR. Recently diffusion models have shown remarkable results in generation quality of 3D objects. However none of the existing models enable disentangled generation to control the shape and appearance separately. For the first time we present a suitable representation for 3D diffusion models to enable such disentanglement by introducing a hybrid point cloud and neural radiance field approach. We model a diffusion process over point positions jointly with a high-dimensional feature space for a local density and radiance decoder. While the point positions represent the coarse shape of the object the point features allow modeling the geometry and appearance details. This disentanglement enables us to sample both independently and therefore to control both separately. Our approach sets a new state of the art in generation compared to previous disentanglement-capable methods by reduced FID scores of 30-90% and is on-par with other non-disentanglement-capable state-of-the art methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Schroppel_Neural_Point_Cloud_Diffusion_for_Disentangled_3D_Shape_and_Appearance_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
VAREN: Very Accurate and Realistic Equine Network,"Zuffi, Silvia, Mellbin, Ylva, Li, Ci, Hoeschle, Markus, Kjellstr√∂m, Hedvig, Polikovsky, Senya, Hernlund, Elin, Black, Michael J.",Data-driven three-dimensional parametric shape models of the human body have gained enormous popularity both for the analysis of visual data and for the generation of synthetic humans. Following a similar approach for animals does not scale to the multitude of existing animal species not to mention the difficulty of accessing subjects to scan in 3D. However we argue that for domestic species of great importance like the horse it is a highly valuable investment to put effort into gathering a large dataset of real 3D scans and learn a realistic 3D articulated shape model. We introduce VAREN a novel 3D articulated parametric shape model learned from 3D scans of many real horses. VAREN bridges synthesis and analysis tasks as the generated model instances have unprecedented realism while being able to represent horses of different sizes and shapes. Differently from previous body models VAREN has two resolutions an anatomical skeleton and interpretable learned pose-dependent deformations which are related to the body muscles. We show with experiments that this formulation has superior performance with respect to previous strategies for modeling pose-dependent deformations in the human body case while also being more compact and allowing an analysis of the relationship between articulation and muscle deformation during articulated motion.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zuffi_VAREN_Very_Accurate_and_Realistic_Equine_Network_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SD-DiT: Unleashing the Power of Self-supervised Discrimination in Diffusion Transformer,"Zhu, Rui, Pan, Yingwei, Li, Yehao, Yao, Ting, Sun, Zhenglong, Mei, Tao, Chen, Chang Wen",Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as the new trend of generative diffusion models on image generation. In view of extremely slow convergence in typical DiT recent breakthroughs have been driven by mask strategy that significantly improves the training efficiency of DiT with additional intra-image contextual learning. Despite this progress mask strategy still suffers from two inherent limitations: (a) training-inference discrepancy and (b) fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction & generative diffusion process resulting in sub-optimal training of DiT. In this work we address these limitations by novelly unleashing the self-supervised discrimination knowledge to boost DiT training. Technically we frame our DiT in a teacher-student manner. The teacher-student discriminative pairs are built on the diffusion noises along the same Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE). Instead of applying mask reconstruction loss over both DiT encoder and decoder we decouple DiT encoder and decoder to separately tackle discriminative and generative objectives. In particular by encoding discriminative pairs with student and teacher DiT encoders a new discriminative loss is designed to encourage the inter-image alignment in the self-supervised embedding space. After that student samples are fed into student DiT decoder to perform the typical generative diffusion task. Extensive experiments are conducted on ImageNet dataset and our method achieves a competitive balance between training cost and generative capacity.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_SD-DiT_Unleashing_the_Power_of_Self-supervised_Discrimination_in_Diffusion_Transformer_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MedBN: Robust Test-Time Adaptation against Malicious Test Samples,"Park, Hyejin, Hwang, Jeongyeon, Mun, Sunung, Park, Sangdon, Ok, Jungseul",Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution to address performance decay due to unforeseen distribution shifts between training and test data. While recent TTA methods excel in adapting to test data variations such adaptability exposes a model to vulnerability against malicious examples an aspect that has received limited attention. Previous studies have uncovered security vulnerabilities within TTA even when a small proportion of the test batch is maliciously manipulated. In response to the emerging threat we propose median batch normalization (MedBN) leveraging the robustness of the median for statistics estimation within the batch normalization layer during test-time inference. Our method is algorithm-agnostic thus allowing seamless integration with existing TTA frameworks. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets including CIFAR10-C CIFAR100-C and ImageNet-C consistently demonstrate that MedBN outperforms existing approaches in maintaining robust performance across different attack scenarios encompassing both instant and cumulative attacks. Through extensive experiments we show that our approach sustains the performance even in the absence of attacks achieving a practical balance between robustness and performance.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Park_MedBN_Robust_Test-Time_Adaptation_against_Malicious_Test_Samples_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Unsupervised Gaze Representation Learning from Multi-view Face Images,"Bao, Yiwei, Lu, Feng",Annotating gaze is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor requiring costly eye-trackers or complex geometric calibration procedures. Although some eye-based unsupervised gaze representation learning methods have been proposed the quality of gaze representation extracted by these methods degrades severely when the head pose is large. In this paper we present the Multi-View Dual-Encoder (MV-DE) a framework designed to learn gaze representations from unlabeled multi-view face images. Through the proposed Dual-Encoder architecture and the multi-view gaze representation swapping strategy the MV-DE successfully disentangles gaze from general facial information and derives gaze representations closely tied to the subject's eyeball rotation without gaze label. Experimental results illustrate that the gaze representations learned by the MV-DE can be used in downstream tasks including gaze estimation and redirection. Gaze estimation results indicates that the proposed MV-DE displays notably higher robustness to uncontrolled head movements when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) unsupervised learning methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bao_Unsupervised_Gaze_Representation_Learning_from_Multi-view_Face_Images_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
AEROBLADE: Training-Free Detection of Latent Diffusion Images Using Autoencoder Reconstruction Error,"Ricker, Jonas, Lukovnikov, Denis, Fischer, Asja",With recent text-to-image models anyone can generate deceptively realistic images with arbitrary contents fueling the growing threat of visual disinformation. A key enabler for generating high-resolution images with low computational cost has been the development of latent diffusion models (LDMs). In contrast to conventional diffusion models LDMs perform the denoising process in the low-dimensional latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder (AE) instead of the high-dimensional image space. Despite their relevance the forensic analysis of LDMs is still in its infancy. In this work we propose AEROBLADE a novel detection method which exploits an inherent component of LDMs: the AE used to transform images between image and latent space. We find that generated images can be more accurately reconstructed by the AE than real images allowing for a simple detection approach based on the reconstruction error. Most importantly our method is easy to implement and does not require any training yet nearly matches the performance of detectors that rely on extensive training. We empirically demonstrate that AEROBLADE is effective against state-of-the-art LDMs including Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. Beyond detection our approach allows for the qualitative analysis of images which can be leveraged for identifying inpainted regions. We release our code and data at https://github.com/jonasricker/aeroblade.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ricker_AEROBLADE_Training-Free_Detection_of_Latent_Diffusion_Images_Using_Autoencoder_Reconstruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Point2CAD: Reverse Engineering CAD Models from 3D Point Clouds,"Liu, Yujia, Obukhov, Anton, Wegner, Jan Dirk, Schindler, Konrad",Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model reconstruction from point clouds is an important problem at the intersection of computer vision graphics and machine learning; it saves the designer significant time when iterating on in-the-wild objects. Recent advancements in this direction achieve relatively reliable semantic segmentation but still struggle to produce an adequate topology of the CAD model. In this work we analyze the current state of the art for that ill-posed task and identify shortcomings of existing methods. We propose a hybrid analytic-neural reconstruction scheme that bridges the gap between segmented point clouds and structured CAD models and can be readily combined with different segmentation backbones. Moreover to power the surface fitting stage we propose a novel implicit neural representation of freeform surfaces driving up the performance of our overall CAD reconstruction scheme. We extensively evaluate our method on the popular ABC benchmark of CAD models and set a new state-of-the-art for that dataset.

LocLLM: Exploiting Generalizable Human Keypoint Localization via Large Language Model,"Wang, Dongkai, Xuan, Shiyu, Zhang, Shiliang",The capacity of existing human keypoint localization models is limited by keypoint priors provided by the training data. To alleviate this restriction and pursue more general model this work studies keypoint localization from a different perspective by reasoning locations based on keypiont clues in text descriptions. We propose LocLLM the first Large-Language Model (LLM) based keypoint localization model that takes images and text instructions as inputs and outputs the desired keypoint coordinates. LocLLM leverages the strong reasoning capability of LLM and clues of keypoint type location and relationship in textual descriptions for keypoint localization. To effectively tune LocLLM we construct localization-based instruction conversations to connect keypoint description with corresponding coordinates in input image and fine-tune the whole model in a parameter-efficient training pipeline. LocLLM shows remarkable performance on standard 2D/3D keypoint localization benchmarks. Moreover incorporating language clues into the localization makes LocLLM show superior flexibility and generalizable capability in cross dataset keypoint localization and even detecting novel type of keypoints unseen during training.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_LocLLM_Exploiting_Generalizable_Human_Keypoint_Localization_via_Large_Language_Model_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MMA-Diffusion: MultiModal Attack on Diffusion Models,"Yang, Yijun, Gao, Ruiyuan, Wang, Xiaosen, Ho, Tsung-Yi, Xu, Nan, Xu, Qiang",In recent years Text-to-Image (T2I) models have seen remarkable advancements gaining widespread adoption. However this progress has inadvertently opened avenues for potential misuse particularly in generating inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. Our work introduces MMA-Diffusion a framework that presents a significant and realistic threat to the security of T2I models by effectively circumventing current defensive measures in both open-source models and commercial online services. Unlike previous approaches MMA-Diffusion leverages both textual and visual modalities to bypass safeguards like prompt filters and post-hoc safety checkers thus exposing and highlighting the vulnerabilities in existing defense mechanisms.

HanDiffuser: Text-to-Image Generation With Realistic Hand Appearances,"Narasimhaswamy, Supreeth, Bhattacharya, Uttaran, Chen, Xiang, Dasgupta, Ishita, Mitra, Saayan, Hoai, Minh",Text-to-image generative models can generate high-quality humans but realism is lost when generating hands. Common artifacts include irregular hand poses shapes incorrect numbers of fingers and physically implausible finger orientations. To generate images with realistic hands we propose a novel diffusion-based architecture called HanDiffuser that achieves realism by injecting hand embeddings in the generative process. HanDiffuser consists of two components: a Text-to-Hand-Params diffusion model to generate SMPL-Body and MANO-Hand parameters from input text prompts and a Text-Guided Hand-Params-to-Image diffusion model to synthesize images by conditioning on the prompts and hand parameters generated by the previous component. We incorporate multiple aspects of hand representation including 3D shapes and joint-level finger positions orientations and articulations for robust learning and reliable performance during inference. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and perform user studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generating images with high-quality hands.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Narasimhaswamy_HanDiffuser_Text-to-Image_Generation_With_Realistic_Hand_Appearances_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Hierarchical Patch Diffusion Models for High-Resolution Video Generation,"Skorokhodov, Ivan, Menapace, Willi, Siarohin, Aliaksandr, Tulyakov, Sergey",Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image and video synthesis. However scaling them to high-resolution inputs is challenging and requires restructuring the diffusion pipeline into multiple independent components limiting scalability and complicating downstream applications. In this work we study patch diffusion models (PDMs) -- a diffusion paradigm which models the distribution of patches rather than whole inputs keeping up to 0.7% of the original pixels. This makes it very efficient during training and unlocks end-to-end optimization on high-resolution videos. We improve PDMs in two principled ways. First to enforce consistency between patches we develop deep context fusion -- an architectural technique that propagates the context information from low-scale to high-scale patches in a hierarchical manner. Second to accelerate training and inference we propose adaptive computation which allocates more network capacity and computation towards coarse image details. The resulting model sets a new state-of-the-art FVD score of 66.32 and Inception Score of 87.68 in class-conditional video generation on UCF-101 256x256 surpassing recent methods by more than 100%. Then we show that it can be rapidly fine-tuned from a base 36x64 low-resolution generator for high-resolution 64x288x512 text-to-video synthesis.

Neural Implicit Morphing of Face Images,"Schardong, Guilherme, Novello, Tiago, Paz, Hallison, Medvedev, Iurii, da Silva, Vin√≠cius, Velho, Luiz, Gon√ßalves, Nuno",Face morphing is a problem in computer graphics with numerous artistic and forensic applications. It is challenging due to variations in pose lighting gender and ethnicity. This task consists of a warping for feature alignment and a blending for a seamless transition between the warped images. We propose to leverage coord-based neural networks to represent such warpings and blendings of face images. During training we exploit the smoothness and flexibility of such networks by combining energy functionals employed in classical approaches without discretizations. Additionally our method is time-dependent allowing a continuous warping/blending of the images. During morphing inference we need both direct and inverse transformations of the time-dependent warping. The first (second) is responsible for warping the target (source) image into the source (target) image. Our neural warping stores those maps in a single network dismissing the need for inverting them. The results of our experiments indicate that our method is competitive with both classical and generative models under the lens of image quality and face-morphing detectors. Aesthetically the resulting images present a seamless blending of diverse faces not yet usual in the literature.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Schardong_Neural_Implicit_Morphing_of_Face_Images_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
UniGS: Unified Representation for Image Generation and Segmentation,"Qi, Lu, Yang, Lehan, Guo, Weidong, Xu, Yu, Du, Bo, Jampani, Varun, Yang, Ming-Hsuan",This paper introduces a novel unified representation of diffusion models for image generation and segmentation. Specifically we use a colormap to represent entity-level masks addressing the challenge of varying entity numbers while aligning the representation closely with the image RGB domain. Two novel modules including the location-aware color palette and progressive dichotomy module are proposed to support our mask representation. On the one hand a location-aware palette guarantees the colors' consistency to entities' locations. On the other hand the progressive dichotomy module can efficiently decode the synthesized colormap to high-quality entity-level masks in a depth-first binary search without knowing the cluster numbers. To tackle the issue of lacking large-scale segmentation training data we employ an inpainting pipeline and then improve the flexibility of diffusion models across various tasks including inpainting image synthesis referring segmentation and entity segmentation. Comprehensive experiments validate the efficiency of our approach demonstrating comparable segmentation mask quality to state-of-the-art and adaptability to multiple tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Qi_UniGS_Unified_Representation_for_Image_Generation_and_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation with Offline Diffusion-Augmented Prototype Generation,"Barsellotti, Luca, Amoroso, Roberto, Cornia, Marcella, Baraldi, Lorenzo, Cucchiara, Rita",Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims at segmenting arbitrary categories expressed in textual form. Previous works have trained over large amounts of image-caption pairs to enforce pixel-level multimodal alignments. However captions provide global information about the semantics of a given image but lack direct localization of individual concepts. Further training on large-scale datasets inevitably brings significant computational costs. In this paper we propose FreeDA a training-free diffusion-augmented method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation which leverages the ability of diffusion models to visually localize generated concepts and local-global similarities to match class-agnostic regions with semantic classes. Our approach involves an offline stage in which textual-visual reference embeddings are collected starting from a large set of captions and leveraging visual and semantic contexts. At test time these are queried to support the visual matching process which is carried out by jointly considering class-agnostic regions and global semantic similarities. Extensive analyses demonstrate that FreeDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets surpassing previous methods by more than 7.0 average points in terms of mIoU and without requiring any training.

HUGS: Human Gaussian Splats,"Kocabas, Muhammed, Chang, Jen-Hao Rick, Gabriel, James, Tuzel, Oncel, Ranjan, Anurag",Recent advances in neural rendering have improved both training and rendering times by orders of magnitude. While these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art quality and speed they are designed for photogrammetry of static scenes and do not generalize well to freely moving humans in the environment. In this work we introduce Human Gaussian Splats (HUGS) that represents an animatable human together with the scene using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method takes only a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames and it automatically learns to disentangle the static scene and a fully animatable human avatar within 30 minutes. We utilize the SMPL body model to initialize the human Gaussians. To capture details that are not modeled by SMPL (e.g cloth hairs) we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model. Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges including the artifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointly optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of individual Gaussians during animation. Our approach enables novel-pose synthesis of human and novel view synthesis of both the human and the scene. We achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality with a rendering speed of 60 FPS while being  100x faster to train over previous work.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kocabas_HUGS_Human_Gaussian_Splats_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PhysPT: Physics-aware Pretrained Transformer for Estimating Human Dynamics from Monocular Videos,"Zhang, Yufei, Kephart, Jeffrey O., Cui, Zijun, Ji, Qiang",While current methods have shown promising progress on estimating 3D human motion from monocular videos their motion estimates are often physically unrealistic because they mainly consider kinematics. In this paper we introduce Physics-aware Pretrained Transformer (PhysPT) which improves kinematics-based motion estimates and infers motion forces. PhysPT exploits a Transformer encoder-decoder backbone to effectively learn human dynamics in a self-supervised manner. Moreover it incorporates physics principles governing human motion. Specifically we build a physics-based body representation and contact force model. We leverage them to impose novel physics-inspired training losses (i.e. force loss contact loss and Euler-Lagrange loss) enabling PhysPT to capture physical properties of the human body and the forces it experiences. Experiments demonstrate that once trained PhysPT can be directly applied to kinematics-based estimates to significantly enhance their physical plausibility and generate favourable motion forces. Furthermore we show that these physically meaningful quantities translate into improved accuracy of an important downstream task: human action recognition.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_PhysPT_Physics-aware_Pretrained_Transformer_for_Estimating_Human_Dynamics_from_Monocular_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
EfficientDreamer: High-Fidelity and Robust 3D Creation via Orthogonal-view Diffusion Priors,"Hu, Zhipeng, Zhao, Minda, Zhao, Chaoyi, Liang, Xinyue, Li, Lincheng, Zhao, Zeng, Fan, Changjie, Zhou, Xiaowei, Yu, Xin",While image diffusion models have made significant progress in text-driven 3D content creation they often fail to accurately capture the intended meaning of text prompts especially for view information. This limitation leads to the Janus problem where multi-faced 3D models are generated under the guidance of such diffusion models. In this paper we propose a robust high-quality 3D content generation pipeline by exploiting orthogonal-view image guidance. First we introduce a novel 2D diffusion model that generates an image consisting of four orthogonal-view sub-images based on the given text prompt. Then the 3D content is created using this diffusion model. Notably the generated orthogonal-view image provides strong geometric structure priors and thus improves 3D consistency. As a result it effectively resolves the Janus problem and significantly enhances the quality of 3D content creation. Additionally we present a 3D synthesis fusion network that can further improve the details of the generated 3D contents. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our method surpasses previous text-to-3D techniques.

HOIAnimator: Generating Text-prompt Human-object Animations using Novel Perceptive Diffusion Models,"Song, Wenfeng, Zhang, Xinyu, Li, Shuai, Gao, Yang, Hao, Aimin, Hou, Xia, Chen, Chenglizhao, Li, Ning, Qin, Hong",To date the quest to rapidly and effectively produce human-object interaction (HOI) animations directly from textual descriptions stands at the forefront of computer vision research. The underlying challenge demands both a discriminating interpretation of language and a comprehensive physics-centric model supporting real-world dynamics. To ameliorate this paper advocates HOIAnimator a novel and interactive diffusion model with perception ability and also ingeniously crafted to revolutionize the animation of complex interactions from linguistic narratives. The effectiveness of our model is anchored in two ground-breaking innovations: (1) Our Perceptive Diffusion Models (PDM) brings together two types of models: one focused on human movements and the other on objects. This combination allows for animations where humans and objects move in concert with each other making the overall motion more realistic. Additionally we propose a Perceptive Message Passing (PMP) mechanism to enhance the communication bridging the two models ensuring that the animations are smooth and unified; (2) We devise an Interaction Contact Field (ICF) a sophisticated model that implicitly captures the essence of HOIs. Beyond mere predictive contact points the ICF assesses the proximity of human and object to their respective environment informed by a probabilistic distribution of interactions learned throughout the denoising phase. Our comprehensive evaluation showcases HOIanimator's superior ability to produce dynamic context-aware animations that surpass existing benchmarks in text-driven animation synthesis.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Song_HOIAnimator_Generating_Text-prompt_Human-object_Animations_using_Novel_Perceptive_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SyncTalk: The Devil is in the Synchronization for Talking Head Synthesis,"Peng, Ziqiao, Hu, Wentao, Shi, Yue, Zhu, Xiangyu, Zhang, Xiaomei, Zhao, Hao, He, Jun, Liu, Hongyan, Fan, Zhaoxin","Achieving high synchronization in the synthesis of realistic speech-driven talking head videos presents a significant challenge. Traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) struggle to maintain consistent facial identity while Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods although they can address this issue often produce mismatched lip movements inadequate facial expressions and unstable head poses. A lifelike talking head requires synchronized coordination of subject identity lip movements facial expressions and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a fundamental flaw leading to unrealistic and artificial outcomes. To address the critical issue of synchronization identified as the ""devil"" in creating realistic talking heads we introduce SyncTalk. This NeRF-based method effectively maintains subject identity enhancing synchronization and realism in talking head synthesis. SyncTalk employs a Face-Sync Controller to align lip movements with speech and innovatively uses a 3D facial blendshape model to capture accurate facial expressions. Our HeadSync Stabilizer optimizes head poses achieving more natural head movements. The Portrait-Sync Generator restores hair details and blends the generated head with the torso for a seamless visual experience. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that SyncTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synchronization and realism.

DreamSalon: A Staged Diffusion Framework for Preserving Identity-Context in Editable Face Generation,"Lin, Haonan","While large-scale pre-trained text-to-image models can synthesize diverse and high-quality human-centered images novel challenges arise with a nuanced task of ""identity fine editing"" - precisely modifying specific features of a subject while maintaining its inherent identity and context. Existing personalization methods either require time-consuming optimization or learning additional encoders adept in ""identity re-contextualization"". However they often struggle with detailed and sensitive tasks like human face editing. To address these challenges we introduce DreamSalon a noise-guided staged-editing framework uniquely focusing on detailed image manipulations and identity-context preservation. By discerning editing and boosting stages via the frequency and gradient of predicted noises DreamSalon first performs detailed manipulations on specific features in the editing stage guided by high-frequency information and then employs stochastic denoising in the boosting stage to improve image quality. For more precise editing DreamSalon semantically mixes source and target textual prompts guided by differences in their embedding covariances to direct the model's focus on specific manipulation areas. Our experiments demonstrate DreamSalon's ability to efficiently and faithfully edit fine details on human faces outperforming existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lin_DreamSalon_A_Staged_Diffusion_Framework_for_Preserving_Identity-Context_in_Editable_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Neural Super-Resolution for Real-time Rendering with Radiance Demodulation,"Li, Jia, Chen, Ziling, Wu, Xiaolong, Wang, Lu, Wang, Beibei, Zhang, Lei",It is time-consuming to render high-resolution images in applications such as video games and virtual reality and thus super-resolution technologies become increasingly popular for real-time rendering. However it is challenging to preserve sharp texture details keep the temporal stability and avoid the ghosting artifacts in real-time super-resolution rendering. To address this issue we introduce radiance demodulation to separate the rendered image or radiance into a lighting component and a material component considering the fact that the light component is smoother than the rendered image so that the high-resolution material component with detailed textures can be easily obtained. We perform the super-resolution on the lighting component only and re-modulate it with the high-resolution material component to obtain the final super-resolution image with more texture details. A reliable warping module is proposed by explicitly marking the occluded regions to avoid the ghosting artifacts. To further enhance the temporal stability we design a frame-recurrent neural network and a temporal loss to aggregate the previous and current frames which can better capture the spatial-temporal consistency among reconstructed frames. As a result our method is able to produce temporally stable results in real-time rendering with high-quality details even in the challenging 4 x4 super-resolution scenarios.

MMM: Generative Masked Motion Model,"Pinyoanuntapong, Ekkasit, Wang, Pu, Lee, Minwoo, Chen, Chen",Recent advances in text-to-motion generation using diffusion and autoregressive models have shown promising results. However these models often suffer from a trade-off between real-time performance high fidelity and motion editability. To address this gap we introduce MMM a novel yet simple motion generation paradigm based on Masked Motion Model. MMM consists of two key components: (1) a motion tokenizer that transforms 3D human motion into a sequence of discrete tokens in latent space and (2) a conditional masked motion transformer that learns to predict randomly masked motion tokens conditioned on the pre-computed text tokens. By attending to motion and text tokens in all directions MMM explicitly captures inherent dependency among motion tokens and semantic mapping between motion and text tokens. During inference this allows parallel and iterative decoding of multiple motion tokens that are highly consistent with fine-grained text descriptions therefore simultaneously achieving high-fidelity and high-speed motion generation. In addition MMM has innate motion editability. By simply placing mask tokens in the place that needs editing MMM automatically fills the gaps while guaranteeing smooth transitions between editing and non-editing parts. Extensive experiments on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that MMM surpasses current leading methods in generating high-quality motion (evidenced by superior FID scores of 0.08 and 0.429) while offering advanced editing features such as body-part modification motion in-betweening and the synthesis of long motion sequences. In addition MMM is two orders of magnitude faster on a single mid-range GPU than editable motion diffusion models.

PEGASUS: Personalized Generative 3D Avatars with Composable Attributes,"Cha, Hyunsoo, Kim, Byungjun, Joo, Hanbyul",We present PEGASUS a method for constructing a personalized generative 3D face avatar from monocular video sources. Our generative 3D avatar enables disentangled controls to selectively alter the facial attributes (e.g. hair or nose) while preserving the identity. Our approach consists of two stages: synthetic database generation and constructing a personalized generative avatar. We generate a synthetic video collection of the target identity with varying facial attributes where the videos are synthesized by borrowing the attributes from monocular videos of diverse identities. Then we build a person-specific generative 3D avatar that can modify its attributes continuously while preserving its identity. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that our method of generating a synthetic database and creating a 3D generative avatar is the most effective in preserving identity while achieving high realism. Subsequently we introduce a zero-shot approach to achieve the same goal of generative modeling more efficiently by leveraging a previously constructed personalized generative model.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cha_PEGASUS_Personalized_Generative_3D_Avatars_with_Composable_Attributes_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Diff-Plugin: Revitalizing Details for Diffusion-based Low-level Tasks,"Liu, Yuhao, Ke, Zhanghan, Liu, Fang, Zhao, Nanxuan, Lau, Rynson W.H.",Diffusion models trained on large-scale datasets have achieved remarkable progress in image synthesis. However due to the randomness in the diffusion process they often struggle with handling diverse low-level tasks that require details preservation. To overcome this limitation we present a new Diff-Plugin framework to enable a single pre-trained diffusion model to generate high-fidelity results across a variety of low-level tasks. Specifically we first propose a lightweight Task-Plugin module with a dual branch design to provide task-specific priors guiding the diffusion process in preserving image content. We then propose a Plugin-Selector that can automatically select different Task-Plugins based on the text instruction allowing users to edit images by indicating multiple low-level tasks with natural language. We conduct extensive experiments on 8 low-level vision tasks. The results demonstrate the superiority of Diff-Plugin over existing methods particularly in real-world scenarios. Our ablations further validate that Diff-Plugin is stable schedulable and supports robust training across different dataset sizes.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Diff-Plugin_Revitalizing_Details_for_Diffusion-based_Low-level_Tasks_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Intelligent Grimm - Open-ended Visual Storytelling via Latent Diffusion Models,"Liu, Chang, Wu, Haoning, Zhong, Yujie, Zhang, Xiaoyun, Wang, Yanfeng, Xie, Weidi",Generative models have recently exhibited exceptional capabilities in text-to-image generation but still struggle to generate image sequences coherently. In this work we focus on a novel yet challenging task of generating a coherent image sequence based on a given storyline denoted as open-ended visual storytelling. We make the following three contributions: (i) to fulfill the task of visual storytelling we propose a learning-based auto-regressive image generation model termed as StoryGen with a novel vision-language context module that enables to generate the current frame by conditioning on the corresponding text prompt and preceding image-caption pairs; (ii) to address the data shortage of visual storytelling we collect paired image-text sequences by sourcing from online videos and open-source E-books establishing processing pipeline for constructing a large-scale dataset with diverse characters storylines and artistic styles named StorySalon; (iii) Quantitative experiments and human evaluations have validated the superiority of our StoryGen where we show it can generalize to unseen characters without any optimization and generate image sequences with coherent content and consistent character.

GenTron: Diffusion Transformers for Image and Video Generation,"Chen, Shoufa, Xu, Mengmeng, Ren, Jiawei, Cong, Yuren, He, Sen, Xie, Yanping, Sinha, Animesh, Luo, Ping, Xiang, Tao, Perez-Rua, Juan-Manuel",In this study we explore Transformer based diffusion models for image and video generation. Despite the dominance of Transformer architectures in various fields due to their flexibility and scalability the visual generative domain primarily utilizes CNN-based U-Net architectures particularly in diffusion-based models. We introduce GenTron a family of Generative models employing Transformer-based diffusion to address this gap. Our initial step was to adapt Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) from class to text conditioning a process involving thorough empirical exploration of the conditioning mechanism. We then scale GenTron from approximately 900M to over 3B parameters observing improvements in visual quality. Furthermore we extend GenTron to text-to-video generation incorporating novel motion-free guidance to enhance video quality. In human evaluations against SDXL GenTron achieves a 51.1% win rate in visual quality (with a 19.8% draw rate) and a 42.3% win rate in text alignment (with a 42.9% draw rate). GenTron notably performs well in T2I-CompBench highlighting its compositional generation ability. We hope GenTron could provide meaningful insights and serve as a valuable reference for future research.

TRIP: Temporal Residual Learning with Image Noise Prior for Image-to-Video Diffusion Models,"Zhang, Zhongwei, Long, Fuchen, Pan, Yingwei, Qiu, Zhaofan, Yao, Ting, Cao, Yang, Mei, Tao",Recent advances in text-to-video generation have demonstrated the utility of powerful diffusion models. Nevertheless the problem is not trivial when shaping diffusion models to animate static image (i.e. image-to-video generation). The difficulty originates from the aspect that the diffusion process of subsequent animated frames should not only preserve the faithful alignment with the given image but also pursue temporal coherence among adjacent frames. To alleviate this we present TRIP a new recipe of image-to-video diffusion paradigm that pivots on image noise prior derived from static image to jointly trigger inter-frame relational reasoning and ease the coherent temporal modeling via temporal residual learning. Technically the image noise prior is first attained through one-step backward diffusion process based on both static image and noised video latent codes. Next TRIP executes a residual-like dual-path scheme for noise prediction: 1) a shortcut path that directly takes image noise prior as the reference noise of each frame to amplify the alignment between the first frame and subsequent frames; 2) a residual path that employs 3D-UNet over noised video and static image latent codes to enable inter-frame relational reasoning thereby easing the learning of the residual noise for each frame. Furthermore both reference and residual noise of each frame are dynamically merged via attention mechanism for final video generation. Extensive experiments on WebVid-10M DTDB and MSR-VTT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our TRIP for image-to-video generation. Please see our project page at https://trip-i2v.github.io/TRIP/.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_TRIP_Temporal_Residual_Learning_with_Image_Noise_Prior_for_Image-to-Video_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
TexVocab: Texture Vocabulary-conditioned Human Avatars,"Liu, Yuxiao, Li, Zhe, Liu, Yebin, Wang, Haoqian",To adequately utilize the available image evidence in multi-view video-based avatar modeling we propose TexVocab a novel avatar representation that constructs a texture vocabulary and associates body poses with texture maps for animation. Given multi-view RGB videos our method initially back-projects all the available images in the training videos to the posed SMPL surface producing texture maps in the SMPL UV domain. Then we construct pairs of human poses and texture maps to establish a texture vocabulary for encoding dynamic human appearances under various poses. Unlike the commonly used joint-wise manner we further design a body-part-wise encoding strategy to learn the structural effects of the kinematic chain. Given a driving pose we query the pose feature hierarchically by decomposing the pose vector into several body parts and interpolating the texture features for synthesizing fine-grained human dynamics. Overall our method is able to create animatable human avatars with detailed and dynamic appearances from RGB videos and the experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_TexVocab_Texture_Vocabulary-conditioned_Human_Avatars_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
KITRO: Refining Human Mesh by 2D Clues and Kinematic-tree Rotation,"Yang, Fengyuan, Gu, Kerui, Yao, Angela",2D keypoints are commonly used as an additional cue to refine estimated 3D human meshes. Current methods optimize the pose and shape parameters with a reprojection loss on the provided 2D keypoints. Such an approach while simple and intuitive has limited effectiveness because the optimal solution is hard to find in ambiguous parameter space and may sacrifice depth. Additionally divergent gradients from distal joints complicate and deviate the refinement of proximal joints in the kinematic chain. To address these we introduce Kinematic-Tree Rotation (KITRO) a novel mesh refinement strategy that explicitly models depth and human kinematic-tree structure. KITRO treats refinement from a bone-wise perspective. Unlike previous methods which perform gradient-based optimizations our method calculates bone directions in closed form. By accounting for the 2D pose bone length and parent joint's depth the calculation results in two possible directions for each child joint. We then use a decision tree to trace binary choices for all bones along the human skeleton's kinematic-tree to select the most probable hypothesis. Our experiments across various datasets and baseline models demonstrate that KITRO significantly improves 3D joint estimation accuracy and achieves an ideal 2D fit simultaneously.

SuGaR: Surface-Aligned Gaussian Splatting for Efficient 3D Mesh Reconstruction and High-Quality Mesh Rendering,"Gu√©don, Antoine, Lepetit, Vincent",We propose a method to allow precise and extremely fast mesh extraction from 3D Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting has recently become very popular as it yields realistic rendering while being significantly faster to train than NeRFs. It is however challenging to extract a mesh from the millions of tiny 3D Gaussians as these Gaussians tend to be unorganized after optimization and no method has been proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a regularization term that encourages the Gaussians to align well with the surface of the scene. We then introduce a method that exploits this alignment to extract a mesh from the Gaussians using Poisson reconstruction which is fast scalable and preserves details in contrast to the Marching Cubes algorithm usually applied to extract meshes from Neural SDFs. Finally we introduce an optional refinement strategy that binds Gaussians to the surface of the mesh and jointly optimizes these Gaussians and the mesh through Gaussian splatting rendering. This enables easy editing sculpting animating and relighting of the Gaussians by manipulating the mesh instead of the Gaussians themselves. Retrieving such an editable mesh for realistic rendering is done within minutes with our method compared to hours with the state-of-the-art method on SDFs while providing a better rendering quality.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Guedon_SuGaR_Surface-Aligned_Gaussian_Splatting_for_Efficient_3D_Mesh_Reconstruction_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Towards Effective Usage of Human-Centric Priors in Diffusion Models for Text-based Human Image Generation,"Wang, Junyan, Sun, Zhenhong, Tan, Zhiyu, Chen, Xuanbai, Chen, Weihua, Li, Hao, Zhang, Cheng, Song, Yang",Vanilla text-to-image diffusion models struggle with generating accurate human images commonly resulting in imperfect anatomies such as unnatural postures or disproportionate limbs. Existing methods address this issue mostly by fine-tuning the model with extra images or adding additional controls --- human-centric priors such as pose or depth maps --- during the image generation phase. This paper explores the integration of these human-centric priors directly into the model fine-tuning stage essentially eliminating the need for extra conditions at the inference stage. We realize this idea by proposing a human-centric alignment loss to strengthen human-related information from the textual prompts within the cross-attention maps. To ensure semantic detail richness and human structural accuracy during fine-tuning we introduce scale-aware and step-wise constraints within the diffusion process according to an in-depth analysis of the cross-attention layer. Extensive experiments show that our method largely improves over state-of-the-art text-to-image models to synthesize high-quality human images based on user-written prompts.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Towards_Effective_Usage_of_Human-Centric_Priors_in_Diffusion_Models_for_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
A Video is Worth 256 Bases: Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization Inversion for Zero-Shot Video Editing,"Li, Maomao, Li, Yu, Yang, Tianyu, Liu, Yunfei, Yue, Dongxu, Lin, Zhihui, Xu, Dong",This paper presents a video inversion approach for zero-shot video editing which models the input video with low-rank representation during the inversion process. The existing video editing methods usually apply the typical 2D DDIM inversion or naive spatial-temporal DDIM inversion before editing which leverages time-varying representation for each frame to derive noisy latent. Unlike most existing approaches we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video. Each frame applies the fixed and global representation for inversion which is more friendly for temporal consistency during reconstruction and editing. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our STEM inversion can achieve consistent improvement on two state-of-the-art video editing methods.

To bridge this gap we present URHand the first universal relightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints poses illuminations and identities. Our model allows few-shot personalization using images captured with a mobile phone and is ready to be photorealistically rendered under novel illuminations. To simplify the personalization process while retaining photorealism we build a powerful universal relightable prior based on neural relighting from multi-view images of hands captured in a light stage with hundreds of identities. The key challenge is scaling the cross-identity training while maintaining personalized fidelity and sharp details without compromising generalization under natural illuminations. To this end we propose a spatially varying linear lighting model as the neural renderer that takes physics-inspired shading as input feature. By removing non-linear activations and bias our specifically designed lighting model explicitly keeps the linearity of light transport. This enables single-stage training from light-stage data while generalizing to real-time rendering under arbitrary continuous illuminations across diverse identities. In addition we introduce the joint learning of a physically based model and our neural relighting model which further improves fidelity and generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of both quality and generalizability.

This strategy enables our model to manipulate images using unseen textual descriptions during inference all within a single training phase. Additionally we proposed an inference technique termed Prompt Ensemble Latent Averaging (PELA). PELA averages the manipulation directions derived from various named entities during inference effectively eliminating the noise directions thus achieving stable manipulation. In our experiments StyleEntity exhibited superior performance in a zero-shot setting compared to other methods. The code model weights and datasets is available at https://github.com/feng-zhida/StyleEntity.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Feng_Named_Entity_Driven_Zero-Shot_Image_Manipulation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ESR-NeRF: Emissive Source Reconstruction Using LDR Multi-view Images,"Jeong, Jinseo, Koo, Junseo, Zhang, Qimeng, Kim, Gunhee",Existing NeRF-based inverse rendering methods suppose that scenes are exclusively illuminated by distant light sources neglecting the potential influence of emissive sources within a scene. In this work we confront this limitation using LDR multi-view images captured with emissive sources turned on and off. Two key issues must be addressed: 1) ambiguity arising from the limited dynamic range along with unknown lighting details and 2) the expensive computational cost in volume rendering to backtrace the paths leading to final object colors. We present a novel approach ESR-NeRF leveraging neural networks as learnable functions to represent ray-traced fields. By training networks to satisfy light transport segments we regulate outgoing radiances progressively identifying emissive sources while being aware of reflection areas. The results on scenes encompassing emissive sources with various properties demonstrate the superiority of ESR-NeRF in qualitative and quantitative ways. Our approach also extends its applicability to the scenes devoid of emissive sources achieving lower CD metrics on the DTU dataset.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jeong_ESR-NeRF_Emissive_Source_Reconstruction_Using_LDR_Multi-view_Images_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Infer from What You Have Seen Before: Temporally-dependent Classifier for Semi-supervised Video Segmentation,"Zhuang, Jiafan, Wang, Zilei, Zhang, Yixin, Fan, Zhun",Due to high expense of human labor one major challenge for semantic segmentation in real-world scenarios is the lack of sufficient pixel-level labels which is more serious when processing video data. To exploit unlabeled data for model training semi-supervised learning methods attempt to construct pseudo labels or various auxiliary constraints as supervision signals. However most of them just process video data as a set of independent images in a per-frame manner. The rich temporal relationships are ignored which can serve as valuable clues for representation learning. Besides this per-frame recognition paradigm is quite different from that of humans. Actually benefited from the internal temporal relevance of video data human would wisely use the distinguished semantic concepts in historical frames to aid the recognition of the current frame. Motivated by this observation we propose a novel temporally-dependent classifier (TDC) to mimic the human-like recognition procedure. Comparing to the conventional classifier TDC can guide the model to learn a group of temporally-consistent semantic concepts across frames which essentially provides an implicit and effective constraint. We conduct extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method to previous state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/jfzhuang/TDC.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhuang_Infer_from_What_You_Have_Seen_Before_Temporally-dependent_Classifier_for_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Video Frame Interpolation via Direct Synthesis with the Event-based Reference,"Liu, Yuhan, Deng, Yongjian, Chen, Hao, Yang, Zhen",Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) has witnessed a surge in popularity due to its abundant downstream applications. Event-based VFI (E-VFI) has recently propelled the advancement of VFI. Thanks to the high temporal resolution benefits event cameras can bridge the informational void present between successive video frames. Most state-of-the-art E-VFI methodologies follow the conventional VFI paradigm which pivots on motion estimation between consecutive frames to generate intermediate frames through a process of warping and refinement. However this reliance engenders a heavy dependency on the quality and consistency of keyframes rendering these methods susceptible to challenges in extreme real-world scenarios such as missing moving objects and severe occlusion dilemmas. This study proposes a novel E-VFI framework that directly synthesize intermediate frames leveraging event-based reference obviating the necessity for explicit motion estimation and substantially enhancing the capacity to handle motion occlusion. Given the sparse and inherently noisy nature of event data we prioritize the reliability of the event-based reference leading to the development of an innovative event-aware reconstruction strategy for accurate reference generation. Besides we implement a bi-directional event-guided alignment from keyframes to the reference using the introduced E-PCD module. Finally a transformer-based decoder is adopted for prediction refinement. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets underscore the superiority of our approach and its potential to execute high-quality VFI tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Video_Frame_Interpolation_via_Direct_Synthesis_with_the_Event-based_Reference_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DSL-FIQA: Assessing Facial Image Quality via Dual-Set Degradation Learning and Landmark-Guided Transformer,"Chen, Wei-Ting, Krishnan, Gurunandan, Gao, Qiang, Kuo, Sy-Yen, Ma, Sizhou, Wang, Jian",Generic Face Image Quality Assessment (GFIQA) evaluates the perceptual quality of facial images which is crucial in improving image restoration algorithms and selecting high-quality face images for downstream tasks. We present a novel transformer-based method for GFIQA which is aided by two unique mechanisms. First a novel Dual-Set Degradation Representation Learning (DSL) mechanism uses facial images with both synthetic and real degradations to decouple degradation from content ensuring generalizability to real-world scenarios. This self-supervised method learns degradation features on a global scale providing a robust alternative to conventional methods that use local patch information in degradation learning. Second our transformer leverages facial landmarks to emphasize visually salient parts of a face image in evaluating its perceptual quality. We also introduce a balanced and diverse Comprehensive Generic Face IQA (CGFIQA-40k) dataset of 40K images carefully designed to overcome the biases in particular the imbalances in skin tone and gender representation in existing datasets. Extensive analysis and evaluation demonstrate the robustness of our method marking a significant improvement over prior methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_DSL-FIQA_Assessing_Facial_Image_Quality_via_Dual-Set_Degradation_Learning_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
FMA-Net: Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering and Iterative Feature Refinement with Multi-Attention for Joint Video Super-Resolution and Deblurring,"Youk, Geunhyuk, Oh, Jihyong, Kim, Munchurl",We present a joint learning scheme of video super-resolution and deblurring called VSRDB to restore clean high-resolution (HR) videos from blurry low-resolution (LR) ones. This joint restoration problem has drawn much less attention compared to single restoration problems. In this paper we propose a novel flow-guided dynamic filtering (FGDF) and iterative feature refinement with multi-attention (FRMA) which constitutes our VSRDB framework denoted as FMA-Net. Specifically our proposed FGDF enables precise estimation of both spatio-temporally-variant degradation and restoration kernels that are aware of motion trajectories through sophisticated motion representation learning. Compared to conventional dynamic filtering the FGDF enables the FMA-Net to effectively handle large motions into the VSRDB. Additionally the stacked FRMA blocks trained with our novel temporal anchor (TA) loss which temporally anchors and sharpens features refine features in a coarse-to-fine manner through iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FMA-Net over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative quality. Codes and pre-trained models are available at: https://kaist-viclab.github.io/fmanet-site.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Youk_FMA-Net_Flow-Guided_Dynamic_Filtering_and_Iterative_Feature_Refinement_with_Multi-Attention_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Transformer-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation,"Li, Wenhao, Liu, Mengyuan, Liu, Hong, Wang, Pichao, Cai, Jialun, Sebe, Nicu",Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT) for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. To effectively achieve this we propose a token pruning cluster (TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition we develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e. Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance applying to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop respectively. Code and models are available at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_Hourglass_Tokenizer_for_Efficient_Transformer-Based_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Boosting Diffusion Models with Moving Average Sampling in Frequency Domain,"Qian, Yurui, Cai, Qi, Pan, Yingwei, Li, Yehao, Yao, Ting, Sun, Qibin, Mei, Tao","Diffusion models have recently brought a powerful revolution in image generation. Despite showing impressive generative capabilities most of these models rely on the current sample to denoise the next one possibly resulting in denoising instability. In this paper we reinterpret the iterative denoising process as model optimization and leverage a moving average mechanism to ensemble all the prior samples. Instead of simply applying moving average to the denoised samples at different timesteps we first map the denoised samples to data space and then perform moving average to avoid distribution shift across timesteps. In view that diffusion models evolve the recovery from low-frequency components to high-frequency details we further decompose the samples into different frequency components and execute moving average separately on each component. We name the complete approach ""Moving Average Sampling in Frequency domain (MASF)"". MASF could be seamlessly integrated into mainstream pre-trained diffusion models and sampling schedules. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional diffusion models demonstrate that our MASF leads to superior performances compared to the baselines with almost negligible additional complexity cost.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Qian_Boosting_Diffusion_Models_with_Moving_Average_Sampling_in_Frequency_Domain_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Bi-Causal: Group Activity Recognition via Bidirectional Causality,"Zhang, Youliang, Liu, Wenxuan, Xu, Danni, Zhou, Zhuo, Wang, Zheng",Current approaches in Group Activity Recognition (GAR) predominantly emphasize Human Relations (HRs) while often neglecting the impact of Human-Object Interactions (HOIs). This study prioritizes the consideration of both HRs and HOIs emphasizing their interdependence. Notably employing Granger Causality Tests reveals the presence of bidirectional causality between HRs and HOIs. Leveraging this insight we propose a Bidirectional-Causal GAR network. This network establishes a causality communication channel while modeling relations and interactions enabling reciprocal enhancement between human-object interactions and human relations ensuring their mutual consistency. Additionally an Interaction Module is devised to effectively capture the dynamic nature of human-object interactions. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets showcase the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Bi-Causal_Group_Activity_Recognition_via_Bidirectional_Causality_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Space-Time Diffusion Features for Zero-Shot Text-Driven Motion Transfer,"Yatim, Danah, Fridman, Rafail, Bar-Tal, Omer, Kasten, Yoni, Dekel, Tali",We present a new method for text-driven motion transfer - synthesizing a video that complies with an input text prompt describing the target objects and scene while maintaining an input video's motion and scene layout. Prior methods are confined to transferring motion across two subjects within the same or closely related object categories and are applicable for limited domains (e.g. humans). In this work we consider a significantly more challenging setting in which the target and source objects differ drastically in shape and fine-grained motion characteristics (e.g. translating a jumping dog into a dolphin). To this end we leverage a pre-trained and fixed text-to-video diffusion model which provides us with generative and motion priors. The pillar of our method is a new space-time feature loss derived directly from the model. This loss guides the generation process to preserve the overall motion of the input video while complying with the target object in terms of shape and fine-grained motion traits.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yatim_Space-Time_Diffusion_Features_for_Zero-Shot_Text-Driven_Motion_Transfer_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MIGC: Multi-Instance Generation Controller for Text-to-Image Synthesis,"Zhou, Dewei, Li, You, Ma, Fan, Zhang, Xiaoting, Yang, Yi",We present a Multi-Instance Generation (MIG) task simultaneously generating multiple instances with diverse controls in one image. Given a set of predefined coordinates and their corresponding descriptions the task is to ensure that generated instances are accurately at the designated locations and that all instances' attributes adhere to their corresponding description. This broadens the scope of current research on Single-instance generation elevating it to a more versatile and practical dimension. Inspired by the idea of divide and conquer we introduce an innovative approach named Multi-Instance Generation Controller (MIGC) to address the challenges of the MIG task. Initially we break down the MIG task into several subtasks each involving the shading of a single instance. To ensure precise shading for each instance we introduce an instance enhancement attention mechanism. Lastly we aggregate all the shaded instances to provide the necessary information for accurately generating multiple instances in stable diffusion (SD). To evaluate how well generation models perform on the MIG task we provide a COCO-MIG benchmark along with an evaluation pipeline. Extensive experiments were conducted on the proposed COCO-MIG benchmark as well as on various commonly used benchmarks. The evaluation results illustrate the exceptional control capabilities of our model in terms of quantity position attribute and interaction. Code and demos will be released at https://migcproject.github.io/.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_MIGC_Multi-Instance_Generation_Controller_for_Text-to-Image_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Distilling CLIP with Dual Guidance for Learning Discriminative Human Body Shape Representation,"Liu, Feng, Kim, Minchul, Ren, Zhiyuan, Liu, Xiaoming",Person Re-Identification (ReID) holds critical importance in computer vision with pivotal applications in public safety and crime prevention. Traditional ReID methods reliant on appearance attributes such as clothing and color encounter limitations in long-term scenarios and dynamic environments. To address these challenges we propose CLIP3DReID an innovative approach that enhances person ReID by integrating linguistic descriptions with visual perception leveraging pretrained CLIP model for knowledge distillation. Our method first employs CLIP to automatically label body shapes with linguistic descriptors. We then apply optimal transport theory to align the student model's local visual features with shape-aware tokens derived from CLIP's linguistic output. Additionally we align the student model's global visual features with those from the CLIP image encoder and the 3D SMPL identity space fostering enhanced domain robustness. CLIP3DReID notably excels in discerning discriminative body shape features achieving state-of-the-art results in person ReID. Our approach represents a significant advancement in ReID offering robust solutions to existing challenges and setting new directions for future research.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Distilling_CLIP_with_Dual_Guidance_for_Learning_Discriminative_Human_Body_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
LLaFS: When Large Language Models Meet Few-Shot Segmentation,"Zhu, Lanyun, Chen, Tianrun, Ji, Deyi, Ye, Jieping, Liu, Jun",This paper proposes LLaFS the first attempt to leverage large language models (LLMs) in few-shot segmentation. In contrast to the conventional few-shot segmentation methods that only rely on the limited and biased information from the annotated support images LLaFS leverages the vast prior knowledge gained by LLM as an effective supplement and directly uses the LLM to segment images in a few-shot manner. To enable the text-based LLM to handle image-related tasks we carefully design an input instruction that allows the LLM to produce segmentation results represented as polygons and propose a region-attribute table to simulate the human visual mechanism and provide multi-modal guidance. We also synthesize pseudo samples and use curriculum learning for pretraining to augment data and achieve better optimization. LLaFS achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets showing the potential of using LLMs for few-shot computer vision tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_LLaFS_When_Large_Language_Models_Meet_Few-Shot_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Kernel Adaptive Convolution for Scene Text Detection via Distance Map Prediction,"Zheng, Jinzhi, Fan, Heng, Zhang, Libo",Segmentation-based scene text detection algorithms that are accurate to the pixel level can satisfy the detection of arbitrary shape scene text and have received widespread attention. On the one hand due to the complexity and diversity of the scene text the convolution with a fixed kernel size has some limitations in extracting the visual features of the scene text. On the other hand most of the existing segmentation-based algorithms only segment the center of the text losing information such as the edges and directions of the text with limited detection accuracy. There are also some improved algorithms that use iterative corrections or introduce other multiple information to improve text detection accuracy but at the expense of efficiency. To address these issues this paper proposes a simple and effective scene text detection method the Kernel Adaptive Convolution which is designed with a Kernel Adaptive Convolution Module for scene text detection via predicting the distance map. Specifically first we design an extensible kernel adaptive convolution module (KACM) to extract visual features from multiple convolutions with different kernel sizes in an adaptive manner. Secondly our method predicts the text distance map under the supervision of a priori information (including direction map and foreground segmentation map) and completes the text detection from the predicted distance map. Experiments on four publicly available datasets prove the effectiveness of our algorithm in which the accuracy and efficiency of both the Total-Text and TD500 outperform the state-of-the-art algorithm. The algorithm efficiency is improved while the accuracy is competitive on ArT and CTW1500.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zheng_Kernel_Adaptive_Convolution_for_Scene_Text_Detection_via_Distance_Map_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Adaptive Multi-Modal Cross-Entropy Loss for Stereo Matching,"Xu, Peng, Xiang, Zhiyu, Qiao, Chengyu, Fu, Jingyun, Pu, Tianyu",Despite the great success of deep learning in stereo matching recovering accurate disparity maps is still challenging. Currently L1 and cross-entropy are the two most widely used losses for stereo network training. Compared with the former the latter usually performs better thanks to its probability modeling and direct supervision to the cost volume. However how to accurately model the stereo ground-truth for cross-entropy loss remains largely under-explored. Existing works simply assume that the ground-truth distributions are uni-modal which ignores the fact that most of the edge pixels can be multi-modal. In this paper a novel adaptive multi-modal cross-entropy loss (ADL) is proposed to guide the networks to learn different distribution patterns for each pixel. Moreover we optimize the disparity estimator to further alleviate the bleeding or misalignment artifacts in inference. Extensive experimental results show that our method is generic and can help classic stereo networks regain state-of-the-art performance. In particular GANet with our method ranks 1st on both the KITTI 2015 and 2012 benchmarks among the published methods. Meanwhile excellent synthetic-to-realistic generalization performance can be achieved by simply replacing the traditional loss with ours. Code is available at https://github.com/xxxupeng/ADL.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_Adaptive_Multi-Modal_Cross-Entropy_Loss_for_Stereo_Matching_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Unlocking the Potential of Prompt-Tuning in Bridging Generalized and Personalized Federated Learning,"Deng, Wenlong, Thrampoulidis, Christos, Li, Xiaoxiao",Vision Transformers (ViT) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) achieve state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency in various computer vision tasks. This suggests a promising paradigm shift of adapting pre-trained ViT models to Federated Learning (FL) settings. However the challenge of data heterogeneity among FL clients presents a significant hurdle in effectively deploying ViT models. Existing Generalized FL (GFL) and Personalized FL (PFL) methods have limitations in balancing performance across both global and local data distributions. In this paper we present a novel algorithm SGPT that integrates GFL and PFL approaches by employing a unique combination of both shared and group-specific prompts. This design enables SGPT to capture both common and group-specific features. A key feature of SGPT is its prompt selection module which facilitates the training of a single global model capable of automatically adapting to diverse local client data distributions without the need for local fine-tuning. To effectively train the prompts we utilize block coordinate descent (BCD) learning from common feature information (shared prompts) and then more specialized knowledge (group prompts) iteratively. Theoretically we justify that learning the proposed prompts can reduce the gap between global and local performance. Empirically we conduct experiments on both label and feature heterogeneity settings in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines along with extensive ablation studies to substantiate the superior performance of SGPT.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Deng_Unlocking_the_Potential_of_Prompt-Tuning_in_Bridging_Generalized_and_Personalized_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
GALA: Generating Animatable Layered Assets from a Single Scan,"Kim, Taeksoo, Kim, Byungjun, Saito, Shunsuke, Joo, Hanbyul",We present GALA a framework that takes as input a single-layer clothed 3D human mesh and decomposes it into complete multi-layered 3D assets. The outputs can then be combined with other assets to create novel clothed human avatars with any pose. Existing reconstruction approaches often treat clothed humans as a single-layer of geometry and overlook the inherent compositionality of humans with hairstyles clothing and accessories thereby limiting the utility of the meshes for down-stream applications. Decomposing a single-layer mesh into separate layers is a challenging task because it requires the synthesis of plausible geometry and texture for the severely occluded regions. Moreover even with successful decomposition meshes are not normalized in terms of poses and body shapes failing coherent composition with novel identities and poses. To address these challenges we propose to leverage the general knowledge of a pretrained 2D diffusion model as geometry and appearance prior for humans and other assets. We first separate the input mesh using the 3D surface segmentation extracted from multi-view 2D segmentations. Then we synthesize the missing geometry of different layers in both posed and canonical spaces using a novel pose-guided Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. Once we complete inpainting high-fidelity 3D geometry we also apply the same SDS loss to its texture to obtain the complete appearance including the initially occluded regions. Through a series of decomposition steps we obtain multiple layers of 3D assets in a shared canonical space normalized in terms of poses and human shapes hence supporting effortless composition to novel identities and reanimation with novel poses. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for decomposition canonicalization and composition tasks compared to existing solutions.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kim_GALA_Generating_Animatable_Layered_Assets_from_a_Single_Scan_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
LeGO: Leveraging a Surface Deformation Network for Animatable Stylized Face Generation with One Example,"Yoon, Soyeon, Yun, Kwan, Seo, Kwanggyoon, Cha, Sihun, Yoo, Jung Eun, Noh, Junyong",Recent advances in 3D face stylization have made significant strides in few to zero-shot settings. However the degree of stylization achieved by existing methods is often not sufficient for practical applications because they are mostly based on statistical 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) with limited variations. To this end we propose a method that can produce a highly stylized 3D face model with desired topology. Our methods train a surface deformation network with 3DMM and translate its domain to the target style using a paired exemplar. The network achieves stylization of the 3D face mesh by mimicking the style of the target using a differentiable renderer and directional CLIP losses. Additionally during the inference process we utilize a Mesh Agnostic Encoder (MAGE) that takes deformation target a mesh of diverse topologies as input to the stylization process and encodes its shape into our latent space. The resulting stylized face model can be animated by commonly used 3DMM blend shapes. A set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our method can produce highly stylized face meshes according to a given style and output them in a desired topology. We also demonstrate example applications of our method including image-based stylized avatar generation linear interpolation of geometric styles and facial animation of stylized avatars.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yoon_LeGO_Leveraging_a_Surface_Deformation_Network_for_Animatable_Stylized_Face_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution for Semantic Segmentation,"Chen, Linwei, Gu, Lin, Zheng, Dezhi, Fu, Ying",Dilated convolution which expands the receptive field by inserting gaps between its consecutive elements is widely employed in computer vision. In this study we propose three strategies to improve individual phases of dilated convolution from the view of spectrum analysis. Departing from the conventional practice of fixing a global dilation rate as a hyperparameter we introduce Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution (FADC) which dynamically adjusts dilation rates spatially based on local frequency components. Subsequently we design two plug-in modules to directly enhance effective bandwidth and receptive field size. The Adaptive Kernel (AdaKern) module decomposes convolution weights into low-frequency and high-frequency components dynamically adjusting the ratio between these components on a per-channel basis. By increasing the high-frequency part of convolution weights AdaKern captures more high-frequency components thereby improving effective bandwidth. The Frequency Selection (FreqSelect) module optimally balances high- and low-frequency components in feature representations through spatially variant reweighting. It suppresses high frequencies in the background to encourage FADC to learn a larger dilation thereby increasing the receptive field for an expanded scope. Extensive experiments on segmentation and object detection consistently validate the efficacy of our approach. The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FADC.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Frequency-Adaptive_Dilated_Convolution_for_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Multiple View Geometry Transformers for 3D Human Pose Estimation,"Liao, Ziwei, Zhu, Jialiang, Wang, Chunyu, Hu, Han, Waslander, Steven L.",In this work we aim to improve the 3D reasoning ability of Transformers in multi-view 3D human pose estimation. Recent works have focused on end-to-end learning-based transformer designs which struggle to resolve geometric information accurately particularly during occlusion. Instead we propose a novel hybrid model MVGFormer which has a series of geometric and appearance modules organized in an iterative manner. The geometry modules are learning-free and handle all viewpoint-dependent 3D tasks geometrically which notably improves the model's generalization ability. The appearance modules are learnable and are dedicated to estimating 2D poses from image signals end-to-end which enables them to achieve accurate estimates even when occlusion occurs leading to a model that is both accurate and generalizable to new cameras and geometries. We evaluate our approach for both in-domain and out-of-domain settings where our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and especially does so by a significant margin in the out-of-domain setting. We will release the code and models: https://github.com/XunshanMan/MVGFormer.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liao_Multiple_View_Geometry_Transformers_for_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SiTH: Single-view Textured Human Reconstruction with Image-Conditioned Diffusion,"I Ho, Hsuan-, Song, Jie, Hilliges, Otmar",A long-standing goal of 3D human reconstruction is to create lifelike and fully detailed 3D humans from single-view images. The main challenge lies in inferring unknown body shapes appearances and clothing details in areas not visible in the images. To address this we propose SiTH a novel pipeline that uniquely integrates an image-conditioned diffusion model into a 3D mesh reconstruction workflow. At the core of our method lies the decomposition of the challenging single-view reconstruction problem into generative hallucination and reconstruction subproblems. For the former we employ a powerful generative diffusion model to hallucinate unseen back-view appearance based on the input images. For the latter we leverage skinned body meshes as guidance to recover full-body texture meshes from the input and back-view images. SiTH requires as few as 500 3D human scans for training while maintaining its generality and robustness to diverse images. Extensive evaluations on two 3D human benchmarks including our newly created one highlighted our method's superior accuracy and perceptual quality in 3D textured human reconstruction. Our code and evaluation benchmark is available at https://ait.ethz.ch/sith.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ho_SiTH_Single-view_Textured_Human_Reconstruction_with_Image-Conditioned_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DynVideo-E: Harnessing Dynamic NeRF for Large-Scale Motion- and View-Change Human-Centric Video Editing,"Liu, Jia-Wei, Cao, Yan-Pei, Wu, Jay Zhangjie, Mao, Weijia, Gu, Yuchao, Zhao, Rui, Keppo, Jussi, Shan, Ying, Shou, Mike Zheng",Despite recent progress in diffusion-based video editing existing methods are limited to short-length videos due to the contradiction between long-range consistency and frame-wise editing. Prior attempts to address this challenge by introducing video-2D representations encounter significant difficulties with large motion- and view-change videos especially in human-centric scenarios. To overcome this we propose to introduce the dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) as the innovative video representation where the editing can be performed in the 3D spaces and propagated to the entire video via the deformation field. To provide consistent and controllable editing we propose the image-based video-NeRF editing pipeline with a set of innovative designs including multi-view multi-pose Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) from both the 2D personalized diffusion prior and 3D diffusion prior reconstruction losses text-guided local parts super-resolution and style transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method dubbed as DynVideo-E significantly outperforms SOTA approaches on two challenging datasets by a large margin of 50%   95% for human preference.

Real-Time Neural BRDF with Spherically Distributed Primitives,"Dou, Yishun, Zheng, Zhong, Jin, Qiaoqiao, Ni, Bingbing, Chen, Yugang, Ke, Junxiang",We propose a neural reflectance model (NeuBRDF) that offers highly versatile material representation yet with light memory and neural computation consumption towards achieving real-time rendering. The results depicted in Fig. 1 rendered at full HD resolution on a contemporary desktop machine demonstrate that our system achieves real-time performance with a wide variety of appearances which is approached by the following two designs. Firstly recognizing that the bidirectional reflectance is distributed in a sparse high-dimensional space we propose to project the BRDF into two low-dimensional components i.e. two hemisphere feature-grids for incoming and outgoing directions respectively. Secondly we distribute learnable neural reflectance primitives on our highly-tailored spherical surface grid. These primitives offer informative features for each hemisphere component and reduce the complexity of the feature learning network leading to fast evaluation. These primitives are centrally stored in a codebook and can be shared across multiple grids and even across materials based on low-cost indices stored in material-specific spherical surface grids. Our NeuBRDF agnostic to the material provides a unified framework for representing a variety of materials consistently.

VideoCrafter2: Overcoming Data Limitations for High-Quality Video Diffusion Models,"Chen, Haoxin, Zhang, Yong, Cun, Xiaodong, Xia, Menghan, Wang, Xintao, Weng, Chao, Shan, Ying",Text-to-video generation aims to produce a video based on a given prompt. Recently several commercial video models have been able to generate plausible videos with minimal noise excellent details and high aesthetic scores. However these models rely on large-scale well-filtered high-quality videos that are not accessible to the community. Many existing research works which train models using the low-quality WebVid-10M dataset struggle to generate high-quality videos because the models are optimized to fit WebVid-10M. In this work we explore the training scheme of video models extended from Stable Diffusion and investigate the feasibility of leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to obtain a high-quality video model. We first analyze the connection between the spatial and temporal modules of video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos. We observe that full training of all modules results in a stronger coupling between spatial and temporal modules than only training temporal modules. Based on this stronger coupling we shift the distribution to higher quality without motion degradation by finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images resulting in a generic high-quality video model. Evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method particularly in picture quality motion and concept composition.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_VideoCrafter2_Overcoming_Data_Limitations_for_High-Quality_Video_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Style Injection in Diffusion: A Training-free Approach for Adapting Large-scale Diffusion Models for Style Transfer,"Chung, Jiwoo, Hyun, Sangeek, Heo, Jae-Pil",Despite the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models existing diffusion model-based style transfer methods require inference-stage optimization (e.g. fine-tuning or textual inversion of style) which is time-consuming or fails to leverage the generative ability of large-scale diffusion models. To address these issues we introduce a novel artistic style transfer method based on a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model without any optimization. Specifically we manipulate the features of self-attention layers as the way the cross-attention mechanism works; in the generation process substituting the key and value of content with those of style image. This approach provides several desirable characteristics for style transfer including 1) preservation of content by transferring similar styles into similar image patches and 2) transfer of style based on similarity of local texture (e.g. edge) between content and style images. Furthermore we introduce query preservation and attention temperature scaling to mitigate the issue of disruption of original content and initial latent Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to deal with the disharmonious color (failure to transfer the colors of style). Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both conventional and diffusion-based style transfer baselines.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chung_Style_Injection_in_Diffusion_A_Training-free_Approach_for_Adapting_Large-scale_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
OrthCaps: An Orthogonal CapsNet with Sparse Attention Routing and Pruning,"Geng, Xinyu, Wang, Jiaming, Gong, Jiawei, Xue, Yuerong, Xu, Jun, Chen, Fanglin, Huang, Xiaolin",Redundancy is a persistent challenge in Capsule Networks (CapsNet) leading to high computational costs and parameter counts. Although previous studies have introduced pruning after the initial capsule layer dynamic routing's fully connected nature and non-orthogonal weight matrices reintroduce redundancy in deeper layers. Besides dynamic routing requires iterating to converge further increasing computational demands. In this paper we propose an Orthogonal Capsule Network (OrthCaps) to reduce redundancy improve routing performance and decrease parameter counts. Firstly an efficient pruned capsule layer is introduced to discard redundant capsules. Secondly dynamic routing is replaced with orthogonal sparse attention routing eliminating the need for iterations and fully connected structures. Lastly weight matrices during routing are orthogonalized to sustain low capsule similarity which is the first approach to use Householder orthogonal decomposition to enforce orthogonality in CapsNet. Our experiments on baseline datasets affirm the efficiency and robustness of OrthCaps in classification tasks in which ablation studies validate the criticality of each component. OrthCaps-Shallow outperforms other Capsule Network benchmarks on four datasets utilizing only 110k parameters - a mere 1.25% of a standard Capsule Network's total. To the best of our knowledge it achieves the smallest parameter count among existing Capsule Networks. Similarly OrthCaps-Deep demonstrates competitive performance across four datasets utilizing only 1.2% of the parameters required by its counterparts.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Geng_OrthCaps_An_Orthogonal_CapsNet_with_Sparse_Attention_Routing_and_Pruning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Florence-2: Advancing a Unified Representation for a Variety of Vision Tasks,"Xiao, Bin, Wu, Haiping, Xu, Weijian, Dai, Xiyang, Hu, Houdong, Lu, Yumao, Zeng, Michael, Liu, Ce, Yuan, Lu",We introduce Florence-2 a novel vision foundation model with a unified prompt-based representation for various computer vision and vision-language tasks. While existing large vision models excel in transfer learning they struggle to perform diverse tasks with simple instructions a capability that implies handling the complexity of various spatial hierarchy and semantic granularity. Florence-2 was designed to take text-prompt as task instructions and generate desirable results in text forms whether it be captioning object detection grounding or segmentation. This multi-task learning setup demands large-scale high-quality annotated data. To this end we co-developed FLD-5B that consists of 5.4 billion comprehensive visual annotations on 126 million images using an iterative strategy of automated image annotation and model refinement. We adopted a sequence-to-sequence structure to train Florence-2 to perform versatile and comprehensive vision tasks. Extensive evaluations on numerous tasks demonstrated Florence-2 to be a strong vision foundation model contender with unprecedented zero-shot and fine-tuning capabilities.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xiao_Florence-2_Advancing_a_Unified_Representation_for_a_Variety_of_Vision_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
NeRF On-the-go: Exploiting Uncertainty for Distractor-free NeRFs in the Wild,"Ren, Weining, Zhu, Zihan, Sun, Boyang, Chen, Jiaqi, Pollefeys, Marc, Peng, Songyou",Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown remarkable success in synthesizing photorealistic views from multi-view images of static scenes but face challenges in dynamic real-world environments with distractors like moving objects shadows and lighting changes. Existing methods manage controlled environments and low occlusion ratios but fall short in render quality especially under high occlusion scenarios. In this paper we introduce NeRF On-the-go a simple yet effective approach that enables the robust synthesis of novel views in complex in-the-wild scenes from only casually captured image sequences. Delving into uncertainty our method not only efficiently eliminates distractors even when they are predominant in captures but also achieves a notably faster convergence speed. Through comprehensive experiments on various scenes our method demonstrates a significant improvement over state-of-the-art techniques. This advancement opens new avenues for NeRF in diverse and dynamic real-world applications.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ren_NeRF_On-the-go_Exploiting_Uncertainty_for_Distractor-free_NeRFs_in_the_Wild_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
3D Human Pose Perception from Egocentric Stereo Videos,"Akada, Hiroyasu, Wang, Jian, Golyanik, Vladislav, Theobalt, Christian",While head-mounted devices are becoming more compact they provide egocentric views with significant self-occlusions of the device user. Hence existing methods often fail to accurately estimate complex 3D poses from egocentric views. In this work we propose a new transformer-based framework to improve egocentric stereo 3D human pose estimation which leverages the scene information and temporal context of egocentric stereo videos. Specifically we utilize 1) depth features from our 3D scene reconstruction module with uniformly sampled windows of egocentric stereo frames and 2) human joint queries enhanced by temporal features of the video inputs. Our method is able to accurately estimate human poses even in challenging scenarios such as crouching and sitting. Furthermore we introduce two new benchmark datasets i.e. UnrealEgo2 and UnrealEgo-RW (RealWorld). UnrealEgo2 is a large-scale in-the-wild dataset captured in synthetic 3D scenes. UnrealEgo-RW is a real-world dataset captured with our newly developed device. The proposed datasets offer a much larger number of egocentric stereo views with a wider variety of human motions than the existing datasets allowing comprehensive evaluation of existing and upcoming methods. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous methods. UnrealEgo2 UnrealEgo-RW and trained models are available on our project page and Benchmark Challenge.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Akada_3D_Human_Pose_Perception_from_Egocentric_Stereo_Videos_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Grid Diffusion Models for Text-to-Video Generation,"Lee, Taegyeong, Kwon, Soyeong, Kim, Taehwan",Recent advances in the diffusion models have significantly improved text-to-image generation. However generating videos from text is a more challenging task than generating images from text due to the much larger dataset and higher computational cost required. Most existing video generation methods use either a 3D U-Net architecture that considers the temporal dimension or autoregressive generation. These methods require large datasets and are limited in terms of computational costs compared to text-to-image generation. To tackle these challenges we propose a simple but effective novel grid diffusion for text-to-video generation without temporal dimension in architecture and a large text-video paired dataset. We can generate a high-quality video using a fixed amount of GPU memory regardless of the number of frames by representing the video as a grid image. Additionally since our method reduces the dimensions of the video to the dimensions of the image various image-based methods can be applied to videos such as text-guided video manipulation from image manipulation. Our proposed method outperforms the existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrating the suitability of our model for real-world video generation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_Grid_Diffusion_Models_for_Text-to-Video_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
LucidDreamer: Towards High-Fidelity Text-to-3D Generation via Interval Score Matching,"Liang, Yixun, Yang, Xin, Lin, Jiantao, Li, Haodong, Xu, Xiaogang, Chen, Yingcong",The recent advancements in text-to-3D generation mark a significant milestone in generative models unlocking new possibilities for creating imaginative 3D assets across various real-world scenarios. While recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have shown promise they often fall short in rendering detailed and high-quality 3D models. This problem is especially prevalent as many methods base themselves on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). This paper identifies a notable deficiency in SDS that it brings inconsistent and low-quality updating direction for the 3D model causing the over-smoothing effect. To address this we propose a novel approach called Interval Score Matching (ISM). ISM employs deterministic diffusing trajectories and utilizes interval-based score matching to counteract over-smoothing. Furthermore we incorporate 3D Gaussian Splatting into our text-to-3D generation pipeline. Extensive experiments show that our model largely outperforms the state-of-the-art in quality and training efficiency.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liang_LucidDreamer_Towards_High-Fidelity_Text-to-3D_Generation_via_Interval_Score_Matching_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PTM-VQA: Efficient Video Quality Assessment Leveraging Diverse PreTrained Models from the Wild,"Yuan, Kun, Liu, Hongbo, Li, Mading, Sun, Muyi, Sun, Ming, Gong, Jiachao, Hao, Jinhua, Zhou, Chao, Tang, Yansong",Video quality assessment (VQA) is a challenging problem due to the numerous factors that can affect the perceptual quality of a video e.g. content attractiveness distortion type motion pattern and level. However annotating the Mean opinion score (MOS) for videos is expensive and time-consuming which limits the scale of VQA datasets and poses a significant obstacle for deep learning-based methods. In this paper we propose a VQA method named PTM-VQA which leverages PreTrained Models to transfer knowledge from models pretrained on various pre-tasks enabling benefits for VQA from different aspects. Specifically we extract features of videos from different pretrained models with frozen weights and integrate them to generate representation. Since these models possess various fields of knowledge and are often trained with labels irrelevant to quality we propose an Intra-Consistency and Inter-Divisibility (ICID) loss to impose constraints on features extracted by multiple pretrained models. The intra-consistency constraint ensures that features extracted by different pretrained models are in the same unified quality-aware latent space while the inter-divisibility introduces pseudo clusters based on the annotation of samples and tries to separate features of samples from different clusters. Furthermore with a constantly growing number of pretrained models it is crucial to determine which models to use and how to use them. To address this problem we propose an efficient scheme to select suitable candidates. Models with better clustering performance on VQA datasets are chosen to be our candidates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yuan_PTM-VQA_Efficient_Video_Quality_Assessment_Leveraging_Diverse_PreTrained_Models_from_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
REACTO: Reconstructing Articulated Objects from a Single Video,"Song, Chaoyue, Wei, Jiacheng, Foo, Chuan Sheng, Lin, Guosheng, Liu, Fayao",In this paper we address the challenge of reconstructing general articulated 3D objects from a single video. Existing works employing dynamic neural radiance fields have advanced the modeling of articulated objects like humans and animals from videos but face challenges with piece-wise rigid general articulated objects due to limitations in their deformation models. To tackle this we propose Quasi-Rigid Blend Skinning a novel deformation model that enhances the rigidity of each part while maintaining flexible deformation of the joints. Our primary insight combines three distinct approaches: 1) an enhanced bone rigging system for improved component modeling 2) the use of quasi-sparse skinning weights to boost part rigidity and reconstruction fidelity and 3) the application of geodesic point assignment for precise motion and seamless deformation. Our method outperforms previous works in producing higher-fidelity 3D reconstructions of general articulated objects as demonstrated on both real and synthetic datasets.

Egocentric Whole-Body Motion Capture with FisheyeViT and Diffusion-Based Motion Refinement,"Wang, Jian, Cao, Zhe, Luvizon, Diogo, Liu, Lingjie, Sarkar, Kripasindhu, Tang, Danhang, Beeler, Thabo, Theobalt, Christian",In this work we explore egocentric whole-body motion capture using a single fisheye camera which simultaneously estimates human body and hand motion. This task presents significant challenges due to three factors: the lack of high-quality datasets fisheye camera distortion and human body self-occlusion. To address these challenges we propose a novel approach that leverages FisheyeViT to extract fisheye image features which are subsequently converted into pixel-aligned 3D heatmap representations for 3D human body pose prediction. For hand tracking we incorporate dedicated hand detection and hand pose estimation networks for regressing 3D hand poses. Finally we develop a diffusion-based whole-body motion prior model to refine the estimated whole-body motion while accounting for joint uncertainties. To train these networks we collect a large synthetic dataset EgoWholeBody comprising 840000 high-quality egocentric images captured across a diverse range of whole-body motion sequences. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing high-quality whole-body motion estimates from a single egocentric camera.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Egocentric_Whole-Body_Motion_Capture_with_FisheyeViT_and_Diffusion-Based_Motion_Refinement_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Language Embedded 3D Gaussians for Open-Vocabulary Scene Understanding,"Shi, Jin-Chuan, Wang, Miao, Duan, Hao-Bin, Guan, Shao-Hua",Open-vocabulary querying in 3D space is challenging but essential for scene understanding tasks such as object localization and segmentation. Language-embedded scene representations have made progress by incorporating language features into 3D spaces. However their efficacy heavily depends on neural networks that are resource-intensive in training and rendering. Although recent 3D Gaussians offer efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis directly embedding language features in them leads to prohibitive memory usage and decreased performance. In this work we introduce Language Embedded 3D Gaussians a novel scene representation for open-vocabulary query tasks. Instead of embedding high-dimensional raw semantic features on 3D Gaussians we propose a dedicated quantization scheme that drastically alleviates the memory requirement and a novel embedding procedure that achieves smoother yet high accuracy query countering the multi-view feature inconsistencies and the high-frequency inductive bias in point-based representations. Our comprehensive experiments show that our representation achieves the best visual quality and language querying accuracy across current language-embedded representations while maintaining real-time rendering frame rates on a single desktop GPU.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shi_Language_Embedded_3D_Gaussians_for_Open-Vocabulary_Scene_Understanding_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Towards Automated Movie Trailer Generation,"Argaw, Dawit Mureja, Soldan, Mattia, Pardo, Alejandro, Zhao, Chen, Heilbron, Fabian Caba, Chung, Joon Son, Ghanem, Bernard",Movie trailers are an essential tool for promoting films and attracting audiences. However the process of creating trailers can be time-consuming and expensive. To streamline this process we propose an automatic trailer generation framework that generates plausible trailers from a full movie by automating shot selection and composition. Our approach draws inspiration from machine translation techniques and models the movies and trailers as sequences of shots thus formulating the trailer generation problem as a sequence-to-sequence task. We introduce Trailer Generation Transformer (TGT) a deep-learning framework utilizing an encoder-decoder architecture. TGT movie encoder is tasked with contextualizing each movie shot representation via self-attention while the autoregressive trailer decoder predicts the feature representation of the next trailer shot accounting for the relevance of shots' temporal order in trailers. Our TGT significantly outperforms previous methods on a comprehensive suite of metrics.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Argaw_Towards_Automated_Movie_Trailer_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Sheared Backpropagation for Fine-tuning Foundation Models,"Yu, Zhiyuan, Shen, Li, Ding, Liang, Tian, Xinmei, Chen, Yixin, Tao, Dacheng",Fine-tuning is the process of extending the training of pre-trained models on specific target tasks thereby significantly enhancing their performance across various applications. However fine-tuning often demands large memory consumption posing a challenge for low-memory devices that some previous memory-efficient fine-tuning methods attempted to mitigate by pruning activations for gradient computation albeit at the cost of significant computational overhead from the pruning processes during training. To address these challenges we introduce PreBackRazor a novel activation pruning scheme offering both computational and memory efficiency through a sparsified backpropagation strategy which judiciously avoids unnecessary activation pruning and storage and gradient computation. Before activation pruning our approach samples a probability of selecting a portion of parameters to freeze utilizing a bandit method for updates to prioritize impactful gradients on convergence. During the feed-forward pass each model layer adjusts adaptively based on parameter activation status obviating the need for sparsification and storage of redundant activations for subsequent backpropagation. Benchmarking on fine-tuning foundation models our approach maintains baseline accuracy across diverse tasks yielding over 20% speedup and around 10% memory reduction. Moreover integrating with an advanced CUDA kernel achieves up to 60% speedup without extra memory costs or accuracy loss significantly enhancing the efficiency of fine-tuning foundation models on memory-constrained devices.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yu_Sheared_Backpropagation_for_Fine-tuning_Foundation_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Misalignment-Robust Frequency Distribution Loss for Image Transformation,"Ni, Zhangkai, Wu, Juncheng, Wang, Zian, Yang, Wenhan, Wang, Hanli, Ma, Lin",This paper aims to address a common challenge in deep learning-based image transformation methods such as image enhancement and super-resolution which heavily rely on precisely aligned paired datasets with pixel-level alignments. However creating precisely aligned paired images presents significant challenges and hinders the advancement of methods trained on such data. To overcome this challenge this paper introduces a novel and simple Frequency Distribution Loss (FDL) for computing distribution distance within the frequency domain. Specifically we transform image features into the frequency domain using Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT). Subsequently frequency components (amplitude and phase) are processed separately to form the FDL loss function. Our method is empirically proven effective as a training constraint due to the thoughtful utilization of global information in the frequency domain. Extensive experimental evaluations focusing on image enhancement and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that FDL outperforms existing misalignment-robust loss functions. Furthermore we explore the potential of our FDL for image style transfer that relies solely on completely misaligned data. Our code is available at: https://github.com/eezkni/FDL,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ni_Misalignment-Robust_Frequency_Distribution_Loss_for_Image_Transformation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Degrees of Freedom Matter: Inferring Dynamics from Point Trajectories,"Zhang, Yan, Prokudin, Sergey, Mihajlovic, Marko, Ma, Qianli, Tang, Siyu",Understanding the dynamics of generic 3D scenes is fundamentally challenging in computer vision essential in enhancing applications related to scene reconstruction motion tracking and avatar creation. In this work we address the task as the problem of inferring dense long-range motion of 3D points. By observing a set of point trajectories we aim to learn an implicit motion field parameterized by a neural network to predict the movement of novel points within the same domain without relying on any data-driven or scene-specific priors. To achieve this our approach builds upon the recently introduced dynamic point field model that learns smooth deformation fields between the canonical frame and individual observation frames. However temporal consistency between consecutive frames is neglected and the number of required parameters increases linearly with the sequence length due to per-frame modeling. To address these shortcomings we exploit the intrinsic regularization provided by SIREN and modify the input layer to produce a spatiotemporally smooth motion field. Additionally we analyze the motion field Jacobian matrix and discover that the motion degrees of freedom (DOFs) in an infinitesimal area around a point and the network hidden variables have different behaviors to affect the model's representational power. This enables us to improve the model representation capability while retaining the model compactness. Furthermore to reduce the risk of overfitting we introduce a regularization term based on the assumption of piece-wise motion smoothness. Our experiments assess the model's performance in predicting unseen point trajectories and its application in temporal mesh alignment with guidance. The results demonstrate its superiority and effectiveness.

Low-Latency Neural Stereo Streaming,"Hou, Qiqi, Farhadzadeh, Farzad, Said, Amir, Sautiere, Guillaume, Le, Hoang",The rise of new video modalities like virtual reality or autonomous driving has increased the demand for efficient multi-view video compression methods both in terms of rate-distortion (R-D) performance and in terms of delay and runtime. While most recent stereo video compression approaches have shown promising performance they compress left and right views sequentially leading to poor parallelization and runtime performance. This work presents Low-Latency neural codec for Stereo video Streaming (LLSS) a novel parallel stereo video coding method designed for fast and efficient low-latency stereo video streaming. Instead of using a sequential cross-view motion compensation like existing methods LLSS introduces a bidirectional feature shifting module to directly exploit mutual information among views and encode them effectively with a joint cross-view prior model for entropy coding. Thanks to this design LLSS processes left and right views in parallel minimizing latency; all while substantially improving R-D performance compared to both existing neural and conventional codecs.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hou_Low-Latency_Neural_Stereo_Streaming_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Intrinsic Image Diffusion for Indoor Single-view Material Estimation,"Kocsis, Peter, Sitzmann, Vincent, Nie√üner, Matthias",We present Intrinsic Image Diffusion a generative model for appearance decomposition of indoor scenes. Given a single input view we sample multiple possible material explanations represented as albedo roughness and metallic maps. Appearance decomposition poses a considerable challenge in computer vision due to the inherent ambiguity between lighting and material properties and the lack of real datasets. To address this issue we advocate for a probabilistic formulation where instead of attempting to directly predict the true material properties we employ a conditional generative model to sample from the solution space. Furthermore we show that utilizing the strong learned prior of recent diffusion models trained on large-scale real-world images can be adapted to material estimation and highly improves the generalization to real images. Our method produces significantly sharper more consistent and more detailed materials outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 1.5dB on PSNR and by 45% better FID score on albedo prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kocsis_Intrinsic_Image_Diffusion_for_Indoor_Single-view_Material_Estimation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Material Palette: Extraction of Materials from a Single Image,"Lopes, Ivan, Pizzati, Fabio, de Charette, Raoul",Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) is key to modeling the interaction between light and materials and finds extensive applications across computer graphics domains. However acquiring PBR materials is costly and requires special apparatus. In this paper we propose a method to extract PBR materials from a single real-world image. We do so in two steps: first we map regions of the image to material concept tokens using a diffusion model allowing the sampling of texture images resembling each material in the scene. Second we leverage a separate network to decompose the generated textures into spatially varying BRDFs (SVBRDFs) offering us readily usable materials for rendering applications. Our approach relies on existing synthetic material libraries with SVBRDF ground truth. It exploits a diffusion-generated RGB texture dataset to allow generalization to new samples using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our contributions are thoroughly evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets. We further demonstrate the applicability of our method for editing 3D scenes with materials estimated from real photographs. Along with video we share code and models as open-source on the project page: https://github.com/astra-vision/MaterialPalette,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lopes_Material_Palette_Extraction_of_Materials_from_a_Single_Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
RealCustom: Narrowing Real Text Word for Real-Time Open-Domain Text-to-Image Customization,"Huang, Mengqi, Mao, Zhendong, Liu, Mingcong, He, Qian, Zhang, Yongdong","Text-to-image customization which aims to synthesize text-driven images for the given subjects has recently revolutionized content creation. Existing works follow the pseudo-word paradigm i.e. represent the given subjects as pseudo-words and then compose them with the given text. However the inherent entangled influence scope of pseudo-words with the given text results in a dual-optimum paradox i.e. the similarity of the given subjects and the controllability of the given text could not be optimal simultaneously. We present RealCustom that for the first time disentangles similarity from controllability by precisely limiting subject influence to relevant parts only achieved by gradually narrowing real text word from its general connotation to the specific subject and using its cross-attention to distinguish relevance. Specifically RealCustom introduces a novel ""train-inference"" decoupled framework: (1) during training RealCustom learns general alignment between visual conditions to original textual conditions by a novel adaptive scoring module to adaptively modulate influence quantity; (2) during inference a novel adaptive mask guidance strategy is proposed to iteratively update the influence scope and influence quantity of the given subjects to gradually narrow the generation of the real text word. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior real-time customization ability of RealCustom in the open domain achieving both unprecedented similarity of the given subjects and controllability of the given text for the first time.

Text2QR: Harmonizing Aesthetic Customization and Scanning Robustness for Text-Guided QR Code Generation,"Wu, Guangyang, Liu, Xiaohong, Jia, Jun, Cui, Xuehao, Zhai, Guangtao",In the digital era QR codes serve as a linchpin connecting virtual and physical realms. Their pervasive integration across various applications highlights the demand for aesthetically pleasing codes without compromised scannability. However prevailing methods grapple with the intrinsic challenge of balancing customization and scannability. Notably stable-diffusion models have ushered in an epoch of high-quality customizable content generation. This paper introduces Text2QR a pioneering approach leveraging these advancements to address a fundamental challenge: concurrently achieving user-defined aesthetics and scanning robustness. To ensure stable generation of aesthetic QR codes we introduce the QR Aesthetic Blueprint (QAB) module generating a blueprint image exerting control over the entire generation process. Subsequently the Scannability Enhancing Latent Refinement (SELR) process refines the output iteratively in the latent space enhancing scanning robustness. This approach harnesses the potent generation capabilities of stable-diffusion models navigating the trade-off between image aesthetics and QR code scannability. Our experiments demonstrate the seamless fusion of visual appeal with the practical utility of aesthetic QR codes markedly outperforming prior methods.

ECLIPSE: A Resource-Efficient Text-to-Image Prior for Image Generations,"Patel, Maitreya, Kim, Changhoon, Cheng, Sheng, Baral, Chitta, Yang, Yezhou",Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models notably the unCLIP models (e.g. DALL-E-2) achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various compositional T2I benchmarks at the cost of significant computational resources. The unCLIP stack comprises T2I prior and diffusion image decoder. The T2I prior model alone adds a billion parameters compared to the Latent Diffusion Models which increases the computational and high-quality data requirements. We introduce ECLIPSE a novel contrastive learning method that is both parameter and data-efficient. ECLIPSE leverages pre-trained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) to distill the knowledge into the prior model. We demonstrate that the ECLIPSE trained prior with only 3.3% of the parameters and trained on a mere 2.8% of the data surpasses the baseline T2I priors with an average of 71.6% preference score under resource-limited setting. It also attains performance on par with SOTA big models achieving an average of 63.36% preference score in terms of the ability to follow the text compositions. Extensive experiments on two unCLIP diffusion image decoders Karlo and Kandinsky affirm that ECLIPSE priors consistently deliver high performance while significantly reducing resource dependency.

Adaptive Bidirectional Displacement for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation,"Chi, Hanyang, Pang, Jian, Zhang, Bingfeng, Liu, Weifeng",Consistency learning is a central strategy to tackle unlabeled data in semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) which enforces the model to produce consistent predictions under the perturbation. However most current approaches solely focus on utilizing a specific single perturbation which can only cope with limited cases while employing multiple perturbations simultaneously is hard to guarantee the quality of consistency learning. In this paper we propose an Adaptive Bidirectional Displacement (ABD) approach to solve the above challenge. Specifically we first design a bidirectional patch displacement based on reliable prediction confidence for unlabeled data to generate new samples which can effectively suppress uncontrollable regions and still retain the influence of input perturbations. Meanwhile to enforce the model to learn the potentially uncontrollable content a bidirectional displacement operation with inverse confidence is proposed for the labeled images which generates samples with more unreliable information to facilitate model learning. Extensive experiments show that ABD achieves new state-of-the-art performances for SSMIS significantly improving different baselines.

Accurate Training Data for Occupancy Map Prediction in Automated Driving Using Evidence Theory,"K√§lble, Jonas, Wirges, Sascha, Tatarchenko, Maxim, Ilg, Eddy",Automated driving fundamentally requires knowledge about the surrounding geometry of the scene. Modern approaches use only captured images to predict occupancy maps that represent the geometry. Training these approaches requires accurate data that may be acquired with the help of LiDAR scanners. We show that the techniques used for current benchmarks and training datasets to convert LiDAR scans into occupancy grid maps yield very low quality and subsequently present a novel approach using evidence theory that yields more accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that these are superior by a large margin both qualitatively and quantitatively and that we additionally obtain meaningful uncertainty estimates. When converting the occupancy maps back to depth estimates and comparing them with the raw LiDAR measurements our method yields a MAE improvement of 30% to 52% on nuScenes and 53% on Waymo over other occupancy ground-truth data. Finally we use the improved occupancy maps to train a state-of-the-art occupancy prediction method and demonstrate that it improves the MAE by 25% on nuScenes.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kalble_Accurate_Training_Data_for_Occupancy_Map_Prediction_in_Automated_Driving_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DiffusionLight: Light Probes for Free by Painting a Chrome Ball,"Phongthawee, Pakkapon, Chinchuthakun, Worameth, Sinsunthithet, Nontaphat, Jampani, Varun, Raj, Amit, Khungurn, Pramook, Suwajanakorn, Supasorn",We present a simple yet effective technique to estimate lighting in a single input image. Current techniques rely heavily on HDR panorama datasets to train neural networks to regress an input with limited field-of-view to a full environment map. However these approaches often struggle with real-world uncontrolled settings due to the limited diversity and size of their datasets. To address this problem we leverage diffusion models trained on billions of standard images to render a chrome ball into the input image. Despite its simplicity this task remains challenging: the diffusion models often insert incorrect or inconsistent objects and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format. Our research uncovers a surprising relationship between the appearance of chrome balls and the initial diffusion noise map which we utilize to consistently generate high-quality chrome balls. We further fine-tune an LDR diffusion model (Stable Diffusion XL) with LoRA enabling it to perform exposure bracketing for HDR light estimation. Our method produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Phongthawee_DiffusionLight_Light_Probes_for_Free_by_Painting_a_Chrome_Ball_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Rethinking the Spatial Inconsistency in Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance,"Shen, Dazhong, Song, Guanglu, Xue, Zeyue, Wang, Fu-Yun, Liu, Yu",Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been widely used in text-to-image diffusion models where the CFG scale is introduced to control the strength of text guidance on the whole image space. However we argue that a global CFG scale results in spatial inconsistency on varying semantic strengths and suboptimal image quality. To address this problem we present a novel approach Semantic-aware Classifier-Free Guidance (S-CFG) to customize the guidance degrees for different semantic units in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically we first design a training-free semantic segmentation method to partition the latent image into relatively independent semantic regions at each denoising step. In particular the cross-attention map in the denoising U-net backbone is renormalized for assigning each patch to the corresponding token while the self-attention map is used to complete the semantic regions. Then to balance the amplification of diverse semantic units we adaptively adjust the CFG scales across different semantic regions to rescale the text guidance degrees into a uniform level. Finally extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S-CFG over the original CFG strategy on various text-to-image diffusion models without requiring any extra training cost. our codes are available at https://github.com/SmilesDZgk/S-CFG.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shen_Rethinking_the_Spatial_Inconsistency_in_Classifier-Free_Diffusion_Guidance_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
KTPFormer: Kinematics and Trajectory Prior Knowledge-Enhanced Transformer for 3D Human Pose Estimation,"Peng, Jihua, Zhou, Yanghong, Mok, P. Y.",This paper presents a novel Kinematics and Trajectory Prior Knowledge-Enhanced Transformer (KTPFormer) which overcomes the weakness in existing transformer-based methods for 3D human pose estimation that the derivation of Q K V vectors in their self-attention mechanisms are all based on simple linear mapping. We propose two prior attention modules namely Kinematics Prior Attention (KPA) and Trajectory Prior Attention (TPA) to take advantage of the known anatomical structure of the human body and motion trajectory information to facilitate effective learning of global dependencies and features in the multi-head self-attention. KPA models kinematic relationships in the human body by constructing a topology of kinematics while TPA builds a trajectory topology to learn the information of joint motion trajectory across frames. Yielding Q K V vectors with prior knowledge the two modules enable KTPFormer to model both spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (Human3.6M MPI-INF-3DHP and HumanEva) show that KTPFormer achieves superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. More importantly our KPA and TPA modules have lightweight plug-and-play designs and can be integrated into various transformer-based networks (i.e. diffusion-based) to improve the performance with only a very small increase in the computational overhead. The code is available at: https://github.com/JihuaPeng/KTPFormer.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Peng_KTPFormer_Kinematics_and_Trajectory_Prior_Knowledge-Enhanced_Transformer_for_3D_Human_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Differentiable Micro-Mesh Construction,"Dou, Yishun, Zheng, Zhong, Jin, Qiaoqiao, Shi, Rui, Li, Yuhan, Ni, Bingbing",Micro-mesh (u-mesh) is a new graphics primitive for compact representation of extreme geometry consisting of a low-polygon base mesh enriched by per micro-vertex displacement. A new generation of GPUs supports this structure with hardware evolution on u-mesh ray tracing achieving real-time rendering in pixel level geometric details. In this article we present a differentiable framework to convert standard meshes into this efficient format offering a holistic scheme in contrast to the previous stage-based methods. In our construction context a u-mesh is defined where each base triangle is a parametric primitive which is then reparameterized with Laplacian operators for efficient geometry optimization. Our framework offers numerous advantages for high-quality u-mesh production: (i) end-to-end geometry optimization and displacement baking; (ii) enabling the differentiation of renderings with respect to umesh for faithful reprojectability; (iii) high scalability for integrating useful features for u-mesh production and rendering such as minimizing shell volume maintaining the isotropy of the base mesh and visual-guided adaptive level of detail. Extensive experiments on u-mesh construction for a large set of high-resolution meshes demonstrate the superior quality achieved by the proposed scheme.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Dou_Differentiable_Micro-Mesh_Construction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SNED: Superposition Network Architecture Search for Efficient Video Diffusion Model,"Li, Zhengang, Kang, Yan, Liu, Yuchen, Liu, Difan, Hinz, Tobias, Liu, Feng, Wang, Yanzhi",While AI-generated content has garnered significant attention achieving photo-realistic video synthesis remains a formidable challenge. Despite the promising advances in diffusion models for video generation quality the complex model architecture and substantial computational demands for both training and inference create a significant gap between these models and real-world applications. This paper presents SNED a superposition network architecture search method for efficient video diffusion model. Our method employs a supernet training paradigm that targets various model cost and resolution options using a weight-sharing method. Moreover we propose the supernet training sampling warm-up for fast training optimization. To showcase the flexibility of our method we conduct experiments involving both pixel-space and latent-space video diffusion models. The results demonstrate that our framework consistently produces comparable results across different model options with high efficiency. According to the experiment for the pixel-space video diffusion model we can achieve consistent video generation results simultaneously across 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 resolutions with a large range of model sizes from 640M to 1.6B number of parameters for pixel-space video diffusion models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_SNED_Superposition_Network_Architecture_Search_for_Efficient_Video_Diffusion_Model_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
LeftRefill: Filling Right Canvas based on Left Reference through Generalized Text-to-Image Diffusion Model,"Cao, Chenjie, Cai, Yunuo, Dong, Qiaole, Wang, Yikai, Fu, Yanwei",This paper introduces LeftRefill an innovative approach to efficiently harness large Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models for reference-guided image synthesis. As the name implies LeftRefill horizontally stitches reference and target views together as a whole input. The reference image occupies the left side while the target canvas is positioned on the right. Then LeftRefill paints the right-side target canvas based on the left-side reference and specific task instructions. Such a task formulation shares some similarities with contextual inpainting akin to the actions of a human painter. This novel formulation efficiently learns both structural and textured correspondence between reference and target without other image encoders or adapters. We inject task and view information through cross-attention modules in T2I models and further exhibit multi-view reference ability via the re-arranged self-attention modules. These enable LeftRefill to perform consistent generation as a generalized model without requiring test-time fine-tuning or model modifications. Thus LeftRefill can be seen as a simple yet unified framework to address reference-guided synthesis. As an exemplar we leverage LeftRefill to address two different challenges: reference-guided inpainting and novel view synthesis based on the pre-trained StableDiffusion. Codes and models are released at https://github.com/ewrfcas/LeftRefill.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cao_LeftRefill_Filling_Right_Canvas_based_on_Left_Reference_through_Generalized_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Personalized Residuals for Concept-Driven Text-to-Image Generation,"Ham, Cusuh, Fisher, Matthew, Hays, James, Kolkin, Nicholas, Liu, Yuchen, Zhang, Richard, Hinz, Tobias",We present personalized residuals and localized attention-guided sampling for efficient concept-driven generation using text-to-image diffusion models. Our method first represents concepts by freezing the weights of a pretrained text-conditioned diffusion model and learning low-rank residuals for a small subset of the model's layers. The residual-based approach then directly enables application of our proposed sampling technique which applies the learned residuals only in areas where the concept is localized via cross-attention and applies the original diffusion weights in all other regions. Localized sampling therefore combines the learned identity of the concept with the existing generative prior of the underlying diffusion model. We show that personalized residuals effectively capture the identity of a concept in  3 minutes on a single GPU without the use of regularization images and with fewer parameters than previous models and localized sampling allows using the original model as strong prior for large parts of the image.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ham_Personalized_Residuals_for_Concept-Driven_Text-to-Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Condition-Aware Neural Network for Controlled Image Generation,"Cai, Han, Li, Muyang, Zhang, Qinsheng, Liu, Ming-Yu, Han, Song",We present Condition-Aware Neural Network (CAN) a new method for adding control to image generative models. In parallel to prior conditional control methods CAN controls the image generation process by dynamically manipulating the weight of the neural network. This is achieved by introducing a condition-aware weight generation module that generates conditional weight for convolution/linear layers based on the input condition. We test CAN on class-conditional image generation on ImageNet and text-to-image generation on COCO. CAN consistently delivers significant improvements for diffusion transformer models including DiT and UViT. In particular CAN combined with EfficientViT (CaT) achieves 2.78 FID on ImageNet 512x512 surpassing DiT-XL/2 while requiring 52x fewer MACs per sampling step.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cai_Condition-Aware_Neural_Network_for_Controlled_Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Prompt Augmentation for Self-supervised Text-guided Image Manipulation,"Bodur, Rumeysa, Bhattarai, Binod, Kim, Tae-Kyun",Text-guided image editing finds applications in various creative and practical fields. While recent studies in image generation have advanced the field they often struggle with the dual challenges of coherent image transformation and context preservation. In response our work introduces prompt augmentation a method amplifying a single input prompt into several target prompts strengthening textual context and enabling localised image editing. Specifically we use the augmented prompts to delineate the intended manipulation area. We propose a Contrastive Loss tailored to driving effective image editing by displacing edited areas and drawing preserved regions closer. Acknowledging the continuous nature of image manipulations we further refine our approach by incorporating the similarity concept creating a Soft Contrastive Loss. The new losses are incorporated to the diffusion model demonstrating improved or competitive image editing results on public datasets and generated images over state-of-the-art approaches.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bodur_Prompt_Augmentation_for_Self-supervised_Text-guided_Image_Manipulation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Guess The Unseen: Dynamic 3D Scene Reconstruction from Partial 2D Glimpses,"Lee, Inhee, Kim, Byungjun, Joo, Hanbyul",In this paper we present a method to reconstruct the world and multiple dynamic humans in 3D from a monocular video input. As a key idea we represent both the world and multiple humans via the recently emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) representation enabling to conveniently and efficiently compose and render them together. In particular we address the scenarios with severely limited and sparse observations in 3D human reconstruction a common challenge encountered in the real world. To tackle this challenge we introduce a novel approach to optimize the 3D-GS representation in a canonical space by fusing the sparse cues in the common space where we leverage a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to synthesize unseen views while keeping the consistency with the observed 2D appearances. We demonstrate our method can reconstruct high-quality animatable 3D humans in various challenging examples in the presence of occlusion image crops few-shot and extremely sparse observations. After reconstruction our method is capable of not only rendering the scene in any novel views at arbitrary time instances but also editing the 3D scene by removing individual humans or applying different motions for each human. Through various experiments we demonstrate the quality and efficiency of our methods over alternative existing approaches.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_Guess_The_Unseen_Dynamic_3D_Scene_Reconstruction_from_Partial_2D_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HyperDreamBooth: HyperNetworks for Fast Personalization of Text-to-Image Models,"Ruiz, Nataniel, Li, Yuanzhen, Jampani, Varun, Wei, Wei, Hou, Tingbo, Pritch, Yael, Wadhwa, Neal, Rubinstein, Michael, Aberman, Kfir",Personalization has emerged as a prominent aspect within the field of generative AI enabling the synthesis of individuals in diverse contexts and styles while retaining high-fidelity to their identities. However the process of personalization presents inherent challenges in terms of time and memory requirements. Fine-tuning each personalized model needs considerable GPU time investment and storing a personalized model per subject can be demanding in terms of storage capacity. To overcome these challenges we propose HyperDreamBooth - a hypernetwork capable of efficiently generating a small set of personalized weights from a single image of a person. By composing these weights into the diffusion model coupled with fast finetuning HyperDreamBooth can generate a person's face in various contexts and styles with high subject details while also preserving the model's crucial knowledge of diverse styles and semantic modifications. Our method achieves personalization on faces in roughly 20 seconds 25x faster than DreamBooth and 125x faster than Textual Inversion using as few as one reference image with the same quality and style diversity as DreamBooth. Also our method yields a model that is 10000x smaller than a normal DreamBooth model.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ruiz_HyperDreamBooth_HyperNetworks_for_Fast_Personalization_of_Text-to-Image_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HardMo: A Large-Scale Hardcase Dataset for Motion Capture,"Liao, Jiaqi, Luo, Chuanchen, Du, Yinuo, Wang, Yuxi, Yin, Xucheng, Zhang, Man, Zhang, Zhaoxiang, Peng, Junran",Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in monocular human mesh recovery. Despite their impressive performance on public benchmarks existing methods are vulnerable to unusual poses which prevents them from deploying to challenging scenarios such as dance and martial arts. This issue is mainly attributed to the domain gap induced by the data scarcity in relevant cases. Most existing datasets are captured in constrained scenarios and lack samples of such complex movements. For this reason we propose a data collection pipeline comprising automatic crawling precise annotation and hardcase mining. Based on this pipeline we establish a large dataset in a short time. The dataset named HardMo contains 7M images along with precise annotations covering 15 categories of dance and 14 categories of martial arts. Empirically we find that the prediction failure in dance and martial arts is mainly characterized by the misalignment of hand-wrist and foot-ankle. To dig deeper into the two hardcases we leverage the proposed automatic pipeline to filter collected data and construct two subsets named HardMo-Hand and HardMo-Foot. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the annotation pipeline and the data-driven solution to failure cases. Specifically after being trained on HardMo HMR an early pioneering method can even outperform the current state of the art 4DHumans on our benchmarks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liao_HardMo_A_Large-Scale_Hardcase_Dataset_for_Motion_Capture_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Separate and Conquer: Decoupling Co-occurrence via Decomposition and Representation for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Yang, Zhiwei, Fu, Kexue, Duan, Minghong, Qu, Linhao, Wang, Shuo, Song, Zhijian",Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels aims to achieve segmentation tasks without dense annotations. However attributed to the frequent coupling of co-occurring objects and the limited supervision from image-level labels the challenging co-occurrence problem is widely present and leads to false activation of objects in WSSS. In this work we devise a 'Separate and Conquer' scheme SeCo to tackle this issue from dimensions of image space and feature space. In the image space we propose to 'separate' the co-occurring objects with image decomposition by subdividing images into patches. Importantly we assign each patch a category tag from Class Activation Maps (CAMs) which spatially helps remove the co-context bias and guide the subsequent representation. In the feature space we propose to 'conquer' the false activation by enhancing semantic representation with multi-granularity knowledge contrast. To this end a dual-teacher-single-student architecture is designed and tag-guided contrast is conducted which guarantee the correctness of knowledge and further facilitate the discrepancy among co-contexts. We streamline the multi-staged WSSS pipeline end-to-end and tackle this issue without external supervision. Extensive experiments are conducted validating the efficiency of our method and the superiority over previous single-staged and even multi-staged competitors on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. Code is available at https://github.com/zwyang6/SeCo.git.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yang_Separate_and_Conquer_Decoupling_Co-occurrence_via_Decomposition_and_Representation_for_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
BiPer: Binary Neural Networks using a Periodic Function,"Vargas, Edwin, Correa, Claudia V., Hinojosa, Carlos, Arguello, Henry",Quantized neural networks employ reduced precision representations for both weights and activations. This quantization process significantly reduces the memory requirements and computational complexity of the network. Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are the extreme quantization case representing values with just one bit. Since the sign function is typically used to map real values to binary values smooth approximations are introduced to mimic the gradients during error backpropagation. Thus the mismatch between the forward and backward models corrupts the direction of the gradient causing training inconsistency problems and performance degradation. In contrast to current BNN approaches we propose to employ a binary periodic (BiPer) function during binarization. Specifically we use a square wave for the forward pass to obtain the binary values and employ the trigonometric sine function with the same period of the square wave as a differentiable surrogate during the backward pass. We demonstrate that this approach can control the quantization error by using the frequency of the periodic function and improves network performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BiPer in benchmark datasets and network architectures with improvements of up to 1% and 0.69% with respect to state-of-the-art methods in the classification task over CIFAR-10 and ImageNet respectively. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/edmav4/BiPer.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Vargas_BiPer_Binary_Neural_Networks_using_a_Periodic_Function_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Segment Any Event Streams via Weighted Adaptation of Pivotal Tokens,"Chen, Zhiwen, Zhu, Zhiyu, Zhang, Yifan, Hou, Junhui, Shi, Guangming, Wu, Jinjian",In this paper we delve into the nuanced challenge of tailoring the Segment Anything Models (SAMs) for integration with event data with the overarching objective of attaining robust and universal object segmentation within the event-centric domain. One pivotal issue at the heart of this endeavor is the precise alignment and calibration of embeddings derived from event-centric data such that they harmoniously coincide with those originating from RGB imagery. Capitalizing on the vast repositories of datasets with paired events and RGB images our proposition is to harness and extrapolate the profound knowledge encapsulated within the pre-trained SAM framework. As a cornerstone to achieving this we introduce a multi-scale feature distillation methodology. This methodology rigorously optimizes the alignment of token embeddings originating from event data with their RGB image counterparts thereby preserving and enhancing the robustness of the overall architecture. Considering the distinct significance that token embeddings from intermediate layers hold for higher-level embeddings our strategy is centered on accurately calibrating the pivotal token embeddings. This targeted calibration is aimed at effectively managing the discrepancies in high-level embeddings originating from both the event and image domains. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distillation method.

AnyDoor: Zero-shot Object-level Image Customization,"Chen, Xi, Huang, Lianghua, Liu, Yu, Shen, Yujun, Zhao, Deli, Zhao, Hengshuang",This work presents AnyDoor a diffusion-based image generator with the power to teleport target objects to new scenes at user-specified locations with desired shapes. Instead of tuning parameters for each object our model is trained only once and effortlessly generalizes to diverse object-scene combinations at the inference stage. Such a challenging zero-shot setting requires an adequate characterization of a certain object. To this end we complement the commonly used identity feature with detail features which are carefully designed to maintain appearance details yet allow versatile local variations(e.g. lighting orientation posture etc.) supporting the object in favorably blending with different surroundings. We further propose to borrow knowledge from video datasets where we can observe various forms (i.e. along the time axis) of a single object leading to stronger model generalizability and robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing alternatives as well as its great potential in real-world applications such as virtual try-on shape editing and object swapping.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_AnyDoor_Zero-shot_Object-level_Image_Customization_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Clustering Propagation for Universal Medical Image Segmentation,"Ding, Yuhang, Li, Liulei, Wang, Wenguan, Yang, Yi",Prominent solutions for medical image segmentation are typically tailored for automatic or interactive setups posing challenges in facilitating progress achieved in one task to another. This also necessitates separate models for each task duplicating both training time and parameters. To address above issues we introduce S2VNet a universal framework that leverages Slice-to-Volume propagation to unify automatic/interactive segmentation within a single model and one training session. Inspired by clustering-based segmentation techniques S2VNet makes full use of the slice-wise structure of volumetric data by initializing cluster centers from the cluster results of previous slice. This enables knowledge acquired from prior slices to assist in the segmentation of the current slice further efficiently bridging the communication between remote slices using mere 2D networks. Moreover such a framework readily accommodates inter- active segmentation with no architectural change simply by initializing centroids from user inputs. S2VNet distinguishes itself by swift inference speeds and reduced memory consumption compared to prevailing 3D solutions. It can also handle multi-class interactions with each of them serving to initialize different centroids. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate S2VNet surpasses task-specified solutions on both automatic/interactive setups.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ding_Clustering_Propagation_for_Universal_Medical_Image_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Garment Recovery with Shape and Deformation Priors,"Li, Ren, Dumery, Corentin, Guillard, Beno√Æt, Fua, Pascal",While modeling people wearing tight-fitting clothing has made great strides in recent years loose-fitting clothing remains a challenge. We propose a method that delivers realistic garment models from real-world images regardless of garment shape or deformation. To this end we introduce a fitting approach that utilizes shape and deformation priors learned from synthetic data to accurately capture garment shapes and deformations including large ones. Not only does our approach recover the garment geometry accurately it also yields models that can be directly used by downstream applications such as animation and simulation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_Garment_Recovery_with_Shape_and_Deformation_Priors_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Psychometry: An Omnifit Model for Image Reconstruction from Human Brain Activity,"Quan, Ruijie, Wang, Wenguan, Tian, Zhibo, Ma, Fan, Yang, Yi",Reconstructing the viewed images from human brain activity bridges human and computer vision through the Brain-Computer Interface. The inherent variability in brain function between individuals leads existing literature to focus on acquiring separate models for each individual using their respective brain signal data ignoring commonalities between these data. In this article we devise Psychometry an omnifit model for reconstructing images from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) obtained from different subjects. Psychometry incorporates an omni mixture-of-experts (Omni MoE) module where all the experts work together to capture the inter-subject commonalities while each expert associated with subject-specific parameters copes with the individual differences. Moreover Psychometry is equipped with a retrieval-enhanced inference strategy termed Ecphory which aims to enhance the learned fMRI representation via retrieving from prestored subject-specific memories. These designs collectively render Psychometry omnifit and efficient enabling it to capture both inter-subject commonality and individual specificity across subjects. As a result the enhanced fMRI representations serve as conditional signals to guide a generation model to reconstruct high-quality and realistic images establishing Psychometry as state-of-the-art in terms of both high-level and low-level metrics.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Quan_Psychometry_An_Omnifit_Model_for_Image_Reconstruction_from_Human_Brain_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Exploring Regional Clues in CLIP for Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Zhang, Yi, Guo, Meng-Hao, Wang, Miao, Hu, Shi-Min",CLIP has demonstrated marked progress in visual recognition due to its powerful pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs. However it still remains a critical challenge: how to transfer image-level knowledge into pixel-level understanding tasks such as semantic segmentation. In this paper to solve the mentioned challenge we analyze the gap between the capability of the CLIP model and the requirement of the zero-shot semantic segmentation task. Based on our analysis and observations we propose a novel method for zero-shot semantic segmentation dubbed CLIP-RC (CLIP with Regional Clues) bringing two main insights. On the one hand a region-level bridge is necessary to provide fine-grained semantics. On the other hand overfitting should be mitigated during the training stage. Benefiting from the above discoveries CLIP-RC achieves state-of-the-art performance on various zero-shot semantic segmentation benchmarks including PASCAL VOC PASCAL Context and COCO-Stuff 164K. Code will be available at https://github.com/Jittor/JSeg.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Exploring_Regional_Clues_in_CLIP_for_Zero-Shot_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Move as You Say Interact as You Can: Language-guided Human Motion Generation with Scene Affordance,"Wang, Zan, Chen, Yixin, Jia, Baoxiong, Li, Puhao, Zhang, Jinlu, Zhang, Jingze, Liu, Tengyu, Zhu, Yixin, Liang, Wei, Huang, Siyuan",Despite significant advancements in text-to-motion synthesis generating language-guided human motion within 3D environments poses substantial challenges. These challenges stem primarily from (i) the absence of powerful generative models capable of jointly modeling natural language 3D scenes and human motion and (ii) the generative models' intensive data requirements contrasted with the scarcity of comprehensive high-quality language-scene-motion datasets. To tackle these issues we introduce a novel two-stage framework that employs scene affordance as an intermediate representation effectively linking 3D scene grounding and conditional motion generation. Our framework comprises an Affordance Diffusion Model (ADM) for predicting explicit affordance map and an Affordance-to-Motion Diffusion Model (AMDM) for generating plausible human motions. By leveraging scene affordance maps our method overcomes the difficulty in generating human motion under multimodal condition signals especially when training with limited data lacking extensive language-scene-motion pairs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms all baselines on established benchmarks including HumanML3D and HUMANISE. Additionally we validate our model's exceptional generalization capabilities on a specially curated evaluation set featuring previously unseen descriptions and scenes.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Move_as_You_Say_Interact_as_You_Can_Language-guided_Human_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Generalizable Face Landmarking Guided by Conditional Face Warping,"Liang, Jiayi, Liu, Haotian, Xu, Hongteng, Luo, Dixin",As a significant step for human face modeling editing and generation face landmarking aims at extracting facial keypoints from images. A generalizable face landmarker is required in practice because real-world facial images e.g. the avatars in animations and games are often stylized in various ways. However achieving generalizable face landmarking is challenging due to the diversity of facial styles and the scarcity of labeled stylized faces. In this study we propose a simple but effective paradigm to learn a generalizable face landmarker based on labeled real human faces and unlabeled stylized faces. Our method learns the face landmarker as the key module of a conditional face warper. Given a pair of real and stylized facial images the conditional face warper predicts a warping field from the real face to the stylized one in which the face landmarker predicts the ending points of the warping field and provides us with high-quality pseudo landmarks for the corresponding stylized facial images. Applying an alternating optimization strategy we learn the face landmarker to minimize i) the discrepancy between the stylized faces and the warped real ones and ii) the prediction errors of both real and pseudo landmarks. Experiments on various datasets show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods in face landmarking tasks leading to a face landmarker with better generalizability.

Sat2Scene: 3D Urban Scene Generation from Satellite Images with Diffusion,"Li, Zuoyue, Li, Zhenqiang, Cui, Zhaopeng, Pollefeys, Marc, Oswald, Martin R.",Directly generating scenes from satellite imagery offers exciting possibilities for integration into applications like games and map services. However challenges arise from significant view changes and scene scale. Previous efforts mainly focused on image or video generation lacking exploration into the adaptability of scene generation for arbitrary views. Existing 3D generation works either operate at the object level or are difficult to utilize the geometry obtained from satellite imagery. To overcome these limitations we propose a novel architecture for direct 3D scene generation by introducing diffusion models into 3D sparse representations and combining them with neural rendering techniques. Specifically our approach generates texture colors at the point level for a given geometry using a 3D diffusion model first which is then transformed into a scene representation in a feed-forward manner. The representation can be utilized to render arbitrary views which would excel in both single-frame quality and inter-frame consistency. Experiments in two city-scale datasets show that our model demonstrates proficiency in generating photo-realistic street-view image sequences and cross-view urban scenes from satellite imagery.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_Sat2Scene_3D_Urban_Scene_Generation_from_Satellite_Images_with_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Control4D: Efficient 4D Portrait Editing with Text,"Shao, Ruizhi, Sun, Jingxiang, Peng, Cheng, Zheng, Zerong, Zhou, Boyao, Zhang, Hongwen, Liu, Yebin",We introduce Control4D an innovative framework for editing dynamic 4D portraits using text instructions. Our method addresses the prevalent challenges in 4D editing notably the inefficiencies of existing 4D representations and the inconsistent editing effect caused by diffusion-based editors. We first propose GaussianPlanes a novel 4D representation that makes Gaussian Splatting more structured by applying plane-based decomposition in 3D space and time. This enhances both efficiency and robustness in 4D editing. Furthermore we propose to leverage a 4D generator to learn a more continuous generation space from inconsistent edited images produced by the diffusion-based editor which effectively improves the consistency and quality of 4D editing. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of Control4D including significantly reduced training time high-quality rendering and spatial-temporal consistency in 4D portrait editing.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shao_Control4D_Efficient_4D_Portrait_Editing_with_Text_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CLIPtone: Unsupervised Learning for Text-based Image Tone Adjustment,"Lee, Hyeongmin, Kang, Kyoungkook, Ok, Jungseul, Cho, Sunghyun",Recent image tone adjustment (or enhancement) approaches have predominantly adopted supervised learning for learning human-centric perceptual assessment. However these approaches are constrained by intrinsic challenges of supervised learning. Primarily the requirement for expertly-curated or retouched images escalates the data acquisition expenses. Moreover their coverage of target styles is confined to stylistic variants inferred from the training data. To surmount the above challenges we propose an unsupervised learning-based approach for text-based image tone adjustment CLIPtone that extends an existing image enhancement method to accommodate natural language descriptions. Specifically we design a hyper-network to adaptively modulate the pretrained parameters of a backbone model based on a text description. To assess whether an adjusted image aligns with its text description without a ground-truth image we utilize CLIP which is trained on a vast set of language-image pairs and thus encompasses the knowledge of human perception. The major advantages of our approach are threefold: (i) minimal data collection expenses (ii) support for a range of adjustments and (iii) the ability to handle novel text descriptions unseen in training. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments including a user study.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_CLIPtone_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Text-based_Image_Tone_Adjustment_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Codebook Transfer with Part-of-Speech for Vector-Quantized Image Modeling,"Zhang, Baoquan, Wang, Huaibin, Luo, Chuyao, Li, Xutao, Liang, Guotao, Ye, Yunming, Qi, Xiaochen, He, Yao",Vector-Quantized Image Modeling (VQIM) is a fundamental research problem in image synthesis which aims to represent an image with a discrete token sequence. Existing studies effectively address this problem by learning a discrete codebook from scratch and in a code-independent manner to quantize continuous representations into discrete tokens. However learning a codebook from scratch and in a code-independent manner is highly challenging which may be a key reason causing codebook collapse i.e. some code vectors can rarely be optimized without regard to the relationship between codes and good codebook priors such that die off finally. In this paper inspired by pretrained language models we find that these language models have actually pretrained a superior codebook via a large number of text corpus but such information is rarely exploited in VQIM. To this end we propose a novel codebook transfer framework with part-of-speech called VQCT which aims to transfer a well-trained codebook from pretrained language models to VQIM for robust codebook learning. Specifically we first introduce a pretrained codebook from language models and part-of-speech knowledge as priors. Then we construct a vision-related codebook with these priors for achieving codebook transfer. Finally a novel codebook transfer network is designed to exploit abundant semantic relationships between codes contained in pretrained codebooks for robust VQIM codebook learning. Experimental results on four datasets show that our VQCT method achieves superior VQIM performance over previous state-of-the-art methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Codebook_Transfer_with_Part-of-Speech_for_Vector-Quantized_Image_Modeling_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
InceptionNeXt: When Inception Meets ConvNeXt,"Yu, Weihao, Zhou, Pan, Yan, Shuicheng, Wang, Xinchao",Inspired by the long-range modeling ability of ViTs large-kernel convolutions are widely studied and adopted recently to enlarge the receptive field and improve model performance like the remarkable work ConvNeXt which employs 7x7 depthwise convolution. Although such depthwise operator only consumes a few FLOPs it largely harms the model efficiency on powerful computing devices due to the high memory access costs. For example ConvNeXt-T has similar FLOPs with ResNet-50 but only achieves  60% throughputs when trained on A100 GPUs with full precision. Although reducing the kernel size of ConvNeXt can improve speed it results in significant performance degradation which poses a challenging problem: How to speed up large-kernel-based CNN models while preserving their performance. To tackle this issue inspired by Inceptions we propose to decompose large-kernel depthwise convolution into four parallel branches along channel dimension i.e. small square kernel two orthogonal band kernels and an identity mapping. With this new Inception depthwise convolution we build a series of networks namely IncepitonNeXt which not only enjoy high throughputs but also maintain competitive performance. For instance InceptionNeXt-T achieves 1.6x higher training throughputs than ConvNeX-T as well as attains 0.2% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K. We anticipate InceptionNeXt can serve as an economical baseline for future architecture design to reduce carbon footprint.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yu_InceptionNeXt_When_Inception_Meets_ConvNeXt_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
LiveHPS: LiDAR-based Scene-level Human Pose and Shape Estimation in Free Environment,"Ren, Yiming, Han, Xiao, Zhao, Chengfeng, Wang, Jingya, Xu, Lan, Yu, Jingyi, Ma, Yuexin",For human-centric large-scale scenes fine-grained modeling for 3D human global pose and shape is significant for scene understanding and can benefit many real-world applications. In this paper we present LiveHPS a novel single-LiDAR-based approach for scene-level human pose and shape estimation without any limitation of light conditions and wearable devices. In particular we design a distillation mechanism to mitigate the distribution-varying effect of LiDAR point clouds and exploit the temporal-spatial geometric and dynamic information existing in consecutive frames to solve the occlusion and noise disturbance. LiveHPS with its efficient configuration and high-quality output is well-suited for real-world applications. Moreover we propose a huge human motion dataset named FreeMotion which is collected in various scenarios with diverse human poses shapes and translations. It consists of multi-modal and multi-view acquisition data from calibrated and synchronized LiDARs cameras and IMUs. Extensive experiments on our new dataset and other public datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance and robustness of our approach. We will release our code and dataset soon.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ren_LiveHPS_LiDAR-based_Scene-level_Human_Pose_and_Shape_Estimation_in_Free_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Segment Every Out-of-Distribution Object,"Zhao, Wenjie, Li, Jia, Dong, Xin, Xiang, Yu, Guo, Yunhui",Semantic segmentation models while effective for in-distribution categories face challenges in real-world deployment due to encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) objects. Detecting these OoD objects is crucial for safety-critical applications. Existing methods rely on anomaly scores but choosing a suitable threshold for generating masks presents difficulties and can lead to fragmentation and inaccuracy. This paper introduces a method to convert anomaly Score To segmentation Mask called S2M a simple and effective framework for OoD detection in semantic segmentation. Unlike assigning anomaly scores to pixels S2M directly segments the entire OoD object. By transforming anomaly scores into prompts for a promptable segmentation model S2M eliminates the need for threshold selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S2M outperforms the state-of-the-art by approximately 20% in IoU and 40% in mean F1 score on average across various benchmarks including Fishyscapes Segment-Me-If-You-Can and RoadAnomaly datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhao_Segment_Every_Out-of-Distribution_Object_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Wavelet-based Fourier Information Interaction with Frequency Diffusion Adjustment for Underwater Image Restoration,"Zhao, Chen, Cai, Weiling, Dong, Chenyu, Hu, Chengwei",Underwater images are subject to intricate and diverse degradation inevitably affecting the effectiveness of underwater visual tasks. However most approaches primarily operate in the raw pixel space of images which limits the exploration of the frequency characteristics of underwater images leading to an inadequate utilization of deep models' representational capabilities in producing high-quality images. In this paper we introduce a novel Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) framework named WF-Diff designed to fully leverage the characteristics of frequency domain information and diffusion models. WF-Diff consists of two detachable networks: Wavelet-based Fourier information interaction network (WFI2-net) and Frequency Residual Diffusion Adjustment Module (FRDAM). With our full exploration of the frequency domain information WFI2-net aims to achieve preliminary enhancement of frequency information in the wavelet space. Our proposed FRDAM can further refine the high- and low-frequency information of the initial enhanced images which can be viewed as a plug-and-play universal module to adjust the detail of the underwater images. With the above techniques our algorithm can show SOTA performance on real-world underwater image datasets and achieves competitive performance in visual quality.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhao_Wavelet-based_Fourier_Information_Interaction_with_Frequency_Diffusion_Adjustment_for_Underwater_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
PoNQ: a Neural QEM-based Mesh Representation,"Maruani, Nissim, Ovsjanikov, Maks, Alliez, Pierre, Desbrun, Mathieu",Although polygon meshes have been a standard representation in geometry processing their irregular and combinatorial nature hinders their suitability for learning-based applications. In this work we introduce a novel learnable mesh representation through a set of local 3D sample Points and their associated Normals and Quadric error metrics (QEM) w.r.t. the underlying shape which we denote PoNQ. A global mesh is directly derived from PoNQ by efficiently leveraging the knowledge of the local quadric errors. Besides marking the first use of QEM within a neural shape representation our contribution guarantees both topological and geometrical properties by ensuring that a PoNQ mesh does not self-intersect and is always the boundary of a volume. Notably our representation does not rely on a regular grid is supervised directly by the target surface alone and also handles open surfaces with boundaries and/or sharp features. We demonstrate the efficacy of PoNQ through a learning-based mesh prediction from SDF grids and show that our method surpasses recent state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both surface and edge-based metrics.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Maruani_PoNQ_a_Neural_QEM-based_Mesh_Representation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Boosting Order-Preserving and Transferability for Neural Architecture Search: a Joint Architecture Refined Search and Fine-tuning Approach,"Zhang, Beichen, Wang, Xiaoxing, Qin, Xiaohan, Yan, Junchi",Supernet is a core component in many recent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods. It not only helps embody the search space but also provides a (relative) estimation of the final performance of candidate architectures. Thus it is critical that the top architectures ranked by a supernet should be consistent with those ranked by true performance which is known as the order-preserving ability. In this work we analyze the order-preserving ability on the whole search space (global) and a sub-space of top architectures (local) and empirically show that the local order-preserving for current two-stage NAS methods still need to be improved. To rectify this we propose a novel concept of Supernet Shifting a refined search strategy combining architecture searching with supernet fine-tuning. Specifically apart from evaluating the training loss is also accumulated in searching and the supernet is updated every iteration. Since superior architectures are sampled more frequently in evolutionary searching the supernet is encouraged to focus on top architectures thus improving local order-preserving. Besides a pre-trained supernet is often un-reusable for one-shot methods. We show that Supernet Shifting can fulfill transferring supernet to a new dataset. Specifically the last classifier layer will be unset and trained through evolutionary searching. Comprehensive experiments show that our method has better order-preserving ability and can find a dominating architecture. Moreover the pre-trained supernet can be easily transferred into a new dataset with no loss of performance.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Boosting_Order-Preserving_and_Transferability_for_Neural_Architecture_Search_a_Joint_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Dr. Bokeh: DiffeRentiable Occlusion-aware Bokeh Rendering,"Sheng, Yichen, Yu, Zixun, Ling, Lu, Cao, Zhiwen, Zhang, Xuaner, Lu, Xin, Xian, Ke, Lin, Haiting, Benes, Bedrich",Bokeh is widely used in photography to draw attention to the subject while effectively isolating distractions in the background. Computational methods can simulate bokeh effects without relying on a physical camera lens but the inaccurate lens modeling in existing filtering-based methods leads to artifacts that need post-processing or learning-based methods to fix. We propose Dr.Bokeh a novel rendering method that addresses the issue by directly correcting the defect that violates the physics in the current filtering-based bokeh rendering equation. Dr.Bokeh first preprocesses the input RGBD to obtain a layered scene representation. Dr.Bokeh then takes the layered representation and user-defined lens parameters to render photo-realistic lens blur based on the novel occlusion-aware bokeh rendering method. Experiments show that the non-learning based renderer Dr.Bokeh outperforms state-of-the-art bokeh rendering algorithms in terms of photo-realism. In addition extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show the more accurate lens model further pushes the limit of a closely related field depth-from-defocus.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sheng_Dr._Bokeh_DiffeRentiable_Occlusion-aware_Bokeh_Rendering_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
LAENeRF: Local Appearance Editing for Neural Radiance Fields,"Radl, Lukas, Steiner, Michael, Kurz, Andreas, Steinberger, Markus",Due to the omnipresence of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) the interest towards editable implicit 3D representations has surged over the last years. However editing implicit or hybrid representations as used for NeRFs is difficult due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry encoded in the model parameters. Despite these challenges recent research has shown first promising steps towards photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance edits. The main open issues of related work include limited interactivity a lack of support for local edits and large memory requirements rendering them less useful in practice. We address these limitations with LAENeRF a unified framework for photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of NeRFs. To tackle local editing we leverage a voxel grid as starting point for region selection. We learn a mapping from expected ray terminations to final output color which can optionally be supervised by a style loss resulting in a framework which can perform photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of selected regions. Relying on a single point per ray for our mapping we limit memory requirements and enable fast optimization. To guarantee interactivity we compose the output color using a set of learned modifiable base colors composed with additive layer mixing. Compared to concurrent work LAENeRF enables recoloring and stylization while keeping processing time low. Furthermore we demonstrate that our approach surpasses baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Radl_LAENeRF_Local_Appearance_Editing_for_Neural_Radiance_Fields_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Adversarial Score Distillation: When score distillation meets GAN,"Wei, Min, Zhou, Jingkai, Sun, Junyao, Zhang, Xuesong",Existing score distillation methods are sensitive to classifier-free guidance (CFG) scale manifested as over-smoothness or instability at small CFG scales while over-saturation at large ones. To explain and analyze these issues we revisit the derivation of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and decipher existing score distillation with the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) paradigm. With the WGAN paradigm we find that existing score distillation either employs a fixed sub-optimal discriminator or conducts incomplete discriminator optimization resulting in the scale-sensitive issue. We propose the Adversarial Score Distillation (ASD) which maintains an optimizable discriminator and updates it using the complete optimization objective. Experiments show that the proposed ASD performs favorably in 2D distillation and text-to-3D tasks against existing methods. Furthermore to explore the generalization ability of our paradigm we extend ASD to the image editing task which achieves competitive results. The project page and code are at https://github.com/2y7c3/ASD,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wei_Adversarial_Score_Distillation_When_score_distillation_meets_GAN_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Vector Graphics Generation via Mutually Impulsed Dual-domain Diffusion,"Zhao, Zhongyin, Chen, Ye, Hu, Zhangli, Chen, Xuanhong, Ni, Bingbing",Intelligent generation of vector graphics has very promising applications in the fields of advertising and logo design artistic painting animation production etc. However current mainstream vector image generation methods lack the encoding of image appearance information that is associated with the original vector representation and therefore lose valid supervision signal from the strong correlation between the discrete vector parameter (drawing instruction) sequence and the target shape/structure of the corresponding pixel image. On the one hand the generation process based on pure vector domain completely ignores the similarity measurement between shape parameter (and their combination) and the paired pixel image appearance pattern; on the other hand two-stage methods (i.e. generation-and-vectorization) based on pixel diffusion followed by differentiable image-to-vector translation suffer from wrong error-correction signal caused by approximate gradients. To address the above issues we propose a novel generation framework based on dual-domain (vector-pixel) diffusion with cross-modality impulse signals from each other. First in each diffusion step the current representation extracted from the other domain is used as a condition variable to constrain the subsequent sampling operation yielding shape-aware new parameterizations; second independent supervision signals from both domains avoid the gradient error accumulation problem caused by cross-domain representation conversion. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks including font and icon datasets demonstrate the great advantages of our proposed framework in terms of generated shape quality.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhao_Vector_Graphics_Generation_via_Mutually_Impulsed_Dual-domain_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ScoreHypo: Probabilistic Human Mesh Estimation with Hypothesis Scoring,"Xu, Yuan, Ma, Xiaoxuan, Su, Jiajun, Zhu, Wentao, Qiao, Yu, Wang, Yizhou",Monocular 3D human mesh estimation is an ill-posed problem characterized by inherent ambiguity and occlusion. While recent probabilistic methods propose generating multiple solutions little attention is paid to obtaining high-quality estimates from them. To address this limitation we introduce ScoreHypo a versatile framework by first leverages our novel HypoNet to generate multiple hypotheses followed by employing a meticulously designed scorer ScoreNet to evaluate and select high-quality estimates. ScoreHypo formulates the estimation process as a reverse denoising process where HypoNet produces a diverse set of plausible estimates that effectively align with the image cues. Subsequently ScoreNet is employed to rigorously evaluate and rank these estimates based on their quality and finally identify superior ones. Experimental results demonstrate that HypoNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art probabilistic methods as a multi-hypothesis mesh estimator. Moreover the estimates selected by ScoreNet significantly outperform random generation or simple averaging. Notably the trained ScoreNet exhibits generalizability as it can effectively score existing methods and significantly reduce their errors by more than 15%.

MeshPose: Unifying DensePose and 3D Body Mesh Reconstruction,"Le, Eric-Tuan, Kakolyris, Antonis, Koutras, Petros, Tam, Himmy, Skordos, Efstratios, Papandreou, George, G√ºler, Riza Alp, Kokkinos, Iasonas",DensePose provides a pixel-accurate association of images with 3D mesh coordinates but does not provide a 3D mesh while Human Mesh Reconstruction (HMR) systems have high 2D reprojection error as measured by DensePose localization metrics. In this work we introduce MeshPose to jointly tackle DensePose and HMR. For this we first introduce new losses that allow us to use weak DensePose supervision to accurately localize in 2D a subset of the mesh vertices ('VertexPose'). We then lift these vertices to 3D yielding a low-poly body mesh ('MeshPose'). Our system is trained in an end-to-end manner and is the first HMR method to attain competitive DensePose accuracy while also being lightweight and amenable to efficient inference making it suitable for real-time AR applications.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Le_MeshPose_Unifying_DensePose_and_3D_Body_Mesh_Reconstruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Unsupervised Salient Instance Detection,"Tian, Xin, Xu, Ke, Lau, Rynson","The significant amount of manual efforts in annotating pixel-level labels has triggered the advancement of unsupervised saliency learning. However without supervision signals state-of-the-art methods can only infer region-level saliency. In this paper we propose to explore the unsupervised salient instance detection (USID) problem for a more fine-grained visual understanding. Our key observation is that self-supervised transformer features may exhibit local similarities as well as different levels of contrast to other regions which provide informative cues to identify salient instances. Hence we propose SCoCo a novel network that models saliency coherence and contrast for USID. SCoCo includes two novel modules: (1) a global background adaptation (GBA) module with a scene-level contrastive loss to extract salient regions from the scene by searching the adaptive ""saliency threshold"" in the self-supervised transformer features and (2) a locality-aware similarity (LAS) module with an instance-level contrastive loss to group salient regions into instances by modeling the in-region saliency coherence and cross-region saliency contrasts. Extensive experiments show that SCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art weakly-supervised SID methods and carefully designed unsupervised baselines and has comparable performances to fully-supervised SID methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Tian_Unsupervised_Salient_Instance_Detection_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Move Anything with Layered Scene Diffusion,"Ren, Jiawei, Xu, Mengmeng, Wu, Jui-Chieh, Liu, Ziwei, Xiang, Tao, Toisoul, Antoine",Diffusion models generate images with an unprecedented level of quality but how can we freely rearrange image layouts? Recent works generate controllable scenes via learning spatially disentangled latent codes but these methods do not apply to diffusion models due to their fixed forward process. In this work we propose SceneDiffusion to optimize a layered scene representation during the diffusion sampling process. Our key insight is that spatial disentanglement can be obtained by jointly denoising scene renderings at different spatial layouts. Our generated scenes support a wide range of spatial editing operations including moving resizing cloning and layer-wise appearance editing operations including object restyling and replacing. Moreover a scene can be generated conditioned on a reference image thus enabling object moving for in-the-wild images. Notably this approach is training-free compatible with general text-to-image diffusion models and responsive in less than a second.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ren_Move_Anything_with_Layered_Scene_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Human Gaussian Splatting: Real-time Rendering of Animatable Avatars,"Moreau, Arthur, Song, Jifei, Dhamo, Helisa, Shaw, Richard, Zhou, Yiren, P√©rez-Pellitero, Eduardo",This work addresses the problem of real-time rendering of photorealistic human body avatars learned from multi-view videos. While the classical approaches to model and render virtual humans generally use a textured mesh recent research has developed neural body representations that achieve impressive visual quality. However these models are difficult to render in real-time and their quality degrades when the character is animated with body poses different than the training observations. We propose an animatable human model based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that has recently emerged as a very efficient alternative to neural radiance fields. The body is represented by a set of gaussian primitives in a canonical space which is deformed with a coarse to fine approach that combines forward skinning and local non-rigid refinement. We describe how to learn our Human Gaussian Splatting (HuGS) model in an end-to-end fashion from multi-view observations and evaluate it against the state-of-the-art approaches for novel pose synthesis of clothed body. Our method achieves 1.5 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art on THuman4 dataset while being able to render in real-time (?80 fps for 512x512 resolution).,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Moreau_Human_Gaussian_Splatting_Real-time_Rendering_of_Animatable_Avatars_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
The Devil is in the Details: StyleFeatureEditor for Detail-Rich StyleGAN Inversion and High Quality Image Editing,"Bobkov, Denis, Titov, Vadim, Alanov, Aibek, Vetrov, Dmitry",The task of manipulating real image attributes through StyleGAN inversion has been extensively researched. This process involves searching latent variables from a well-trained StyleGAN generator that can synthesize a real image modifying these latent variables and then synthesizing an image with the desired edits. A balance must be struck between the quality of the reconstruction and the ability to edit. Earlier studies utilized the low-dimensional W-space for latent search which facilitated effective editing but struggled with reconstructing intricate details. More recent research has turned to the high-dimensional feature space F which successfully inverses the input image but loses much of the detail during editing. In this paper we introduce StyleFeatureEditor -- a novel method that enables editing in both w-latents and F-latents. This technique not only allows for the reconstruction of finer image details but also ensures their preservation during editing. We also present a new training pipeline specifically designed to train our model to accurately edit F-latents. Our method is compared with state-of-the-art encoding approaches demonstrating that our model excels in terms of reconstruction quality and is capable of editing even challenging out-of-domain examples.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bobkov_The_Devil_is_in_the_Details_StyleFeatureEditor_for_Detail-Rich_StyleGAN_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Unbiased Estimator for Distorted Conics in Camera Calibration,"Song, Chaehyeon, Shin, Jaeho, Jeon, Myung-Hwan, Lim, Jongwoo, Kim, Ayoung",In the literature points and conics have been major features for camera geometric calibration. Although conics are more informative features than points the loss of the conic property under distortion has critically limited the utility of conic features in camera calibration. Many existing approaches addressed conic-based calibration by ignoring distortion or introducing 3D spherical targets to circumvent this limitation. In this paper we present a novel formulation for conic-based calibration using moments. Our derivation is based on the mathematical finding that the first moment can be estimated without bias even under distortion. This allows us to track moment changes during projection and distortion ensuring the preservation of the first moment of the distorted conic. With an unbiased estimator the circular patterns can be accurately detected at the sub-pixel level and can now be fully exploited for an entire calibration pipeline resulting in significantly improved calibration. The entire code is readily available from https://github.com/ChaehyeonSong/discocal.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Song_Unbiased_Estimator_for_Distorted_Conics_in_Camera_Calibration_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MultiPhys: Multi-Person Physics-aware 3D Motion Estimation,"Ugrinovic, Nicolas, Pan, Boxiao, Pavlakos, Georgios, Paschalidou, Despoina, Shen, Bokui, Sanchez-Riera, Jordi, Moreno-Noguer, Francesc, Guibas, Leonidas",We introduce MultiPhys a method designed for recovering multi-person motion from monocular videos. Our focus lies in capturing coherent spatial placement between pairs of individuals across varying degrees of engagement. MultiPhys being physically aware exhibits robustness to jittering and occlusions and effectively eliminates penetration issues between the two individuals. We devise a pipeline in which the motion estimated by a kinematic-based method is fed into a physics simulator in an autoregressive manner. We introduce distinct components that enable our model to harness the simulator's properties without compromising the accuracy of the kinematic estimates. This results in final motion estimates that are both kinematically coherent and physically compliant. Extensive evaluations on three challenging datasets characterized by substantial inter-person interaction show that our method significantly reduces errors associated with penetration and foot skating while performing competitively with the state-of-the-art on motion accuracy and smoothness.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ugrinovic_MultiPhys_Multi-Person_Physics-aware_3D_Motion_Estimation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
NIVeL: Neural Implicit Vector Layers for Text-to-Vector Generation,"Thamizharasan, Vikas, Liu, Difan, Fisher, Matthew, Zhao, Nanxuan, Kalogerakis, Evangelos, Lukac, Michal",The success of denoising diffusion models in representing rich data distributions over 2D raster images has prompted research on extending them to other data representations such as vector graphics. Unfortunately due to their variable structure and scarcity of vector training data directly applying diffusion models on this domain remains a challenging problem. Using workarounds like optimization via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) is also fraught with difficulty as vector representations are non-trivial to directly optimize and tend to result in implausible geometries such as redundant or self-intersecting shapes. NIVeL addresses these challenges by reinterpreting the problem on an alternative intermediate domain which preserves the desirable properties of vector graphics - mainly sparsity of representation and resolution-independence. This alternative domain is based on neural implicit fields expressed in a set of decomposable editable layers. Based on our experiments NIVeL produces text-to-vector graphics results of significantly better quality than the state-of-the-art.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Thamizharasan_NIVeL_Neural_Implicit_Vector_Layers_for_Text-to-Vector_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
OAKINK2: A Dataset of Bimanual Hands-Object Manipulation in Complex Task Completion,"Zhan, Xinyu, Yang, Lixin, Zhao, Yifei, Mao, Kangrui, Xu, Hanlin, Lin, Zenan, Li, Kailin, Lu, Cewu",We present OAKINK2 a dataset of bimanual object manipulation tasks for complex daily activities. In pursuit of constructing the complex tasks into a structured representation OAKINK2 introduces three level of abstraction to organize the manipulation tasks: Affordance Primitive Task and Complex Task. OAKINK2 features on an object-centric perspective for decoding the complex tasks treating them as a sequence of object affordance fulfillment. The first level Affordance outlines the functionalities that objects in the scene can afford the second level Primitive Task describes the minimal interaction units that humans interact with the object to achieve its affordance and the third level Complex Task illustrates how Primitive Tasks are composed and interdependent. OAKINK2 dataset provides multi-view image streams and precise pose annotations for the human body hands and various interacting objects. This extensive collection supports applications such as interaction reconstruction and motion synthesis. Based on the 3-level abstraction of OAKINK2 we explore a task-oriented framework for Complex Task Completion (CTC). CTC aims to generate a sequence of bimanual manipulation to achieve task objectives. Within the CTC framework we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose the complex task objectives into sequences of Primitive Tasks and have developed a Motion Fulfillment Model that generates bimanual hand motion for each Primitive Task. OAKINK2 datasets and models are available at https://oakink.net/v2.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhan_OAKINK2_A_Dataset_of_Bimanual_Hands-Object_Manipulation_in_Complex_Task_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Text-Guided 3D Face Synthesis - From Generation to Editing,"Wu, Yunjie, Meng, Yapeng, Hu, Zhipeng, Li, Lincheng, Wu, Haoqian, Zhou, Kun, Xu, Weiwei, Yu, Xin",Text-guided 3D face synthesis has achieved remarkable results by leveraging text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. However most existing works focus solely on the direct generation ignoring the editing restricting them from synthesizing customized 3D faces through iterative adjustments. In this paper we propose a unified text-guided framework from face generation to editing. In the generation stage we propose a geometry-texture decoupled generation to mitigate the loss of geometric details caused by coupling. Besides decoupling enables us to utilize the generated geometry as a condition for texture generation yielding highly geometry-texture aligned results. We further employ a fine-tuned texture diffusion model to enhance texture quality in both RGB and YUV space. In the editing stage we first employ a pre-trained diffusion model to update facial geometry or texture based on the texts. To enable sequential editing we introduce a UV domain consistency preservation regularization preventing unintentional changes to irrelevant facial attributes. Besides we propose a self-guided consistency weight strategy to improve editing efficacy while preserving consistency. Through comprehensive experiments we showcase our method's superiority in face synthesis.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wu_Text-Guided_3D_Face_Synthesis_-_From_Generation_to_Editing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Multiplane Prior Guided Few-Shot Aerial Scene Rendering,"Gao, Zihan, Jiao, Licheng, Li, Lingling, Liu, Xu, Liu, Fang, Chen, Puhua, Guo, Yuwei",Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been successfully applied in various aerial scenes yet they face challenges with sparse views due to limited supervision. The acquisition of dense aerial views is often prohibitive as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may encounter constraints in perspective range and energy constraints. In this work we introduce Multiplane Prior guided NeRF (MPNeRF) a novel approach tailored for few-shot aerial scene rendering--marking a pioneering effort in this domain. Our key insight is that the intrinsic geometric regularities specific to aerial imagery could be leveraged to enhance NeRF in sparse aerial scenes. By investigating NeRF's and Multiplane Image (MPI)'s behavior we propose to guide the training process of NeRF with a Multiplane Prior. The proposed Multiplane Prior draws upon MPI's benefits and incorporates advanced image comprehension through a SwinV2 Transformer pre-trained via SimMIM. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MPNeRF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods applied in non-aerial contexts by tripling the performance in SSIM and LPIPS even with three views available. We hope our work offers insights into the development of NeRF-based applications in aerial scenes with limited data.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Gao_Multiplane_Prior_Guided_Few-Shot_Aerial_Scene_Rendering_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MAS: Multi-view Ancestral Sampling for 3D Motion Generation Using 2D Diffusion,"Kapon, Roy, Tevet, Guy, Cohen-Or, Daniel, Bermano, Amit H.",We introduce Multi-view Ancestral Sampling (MAS) a method for 3D motion generation using 2D diffusion models that were trained on motions obtained from in-the-wild videos. As such MAS opens opportunities to exciting and diverse fields of motion previously under-explored as 3D data is scarce and hard to collect. MAS works by simultaneously denoising multiple 2D motion sequences representing different views of the same 3D motion. It ensures consistency across all views at each diffusion step by combining the individual generations into a unified 3D sequence and projecting it back to the original views. We demonstrate MAS on 2D pose data acquired from videos depicting professional basketball maneuvers rhythmic gymnastic performances featuring a ball apparatus and horse races. In each of these domains 3D motion capture is arduous and yet MAS generates diverse and realistic 3D sequences. Unlike the Score Distillation approach which optimizes each sample by repeatedly applying small fixes our method uses a sampling process that was constructed for the diffusion framework. As we demonstrate MAS avoids common issues such as out-of-domain sampling and mode-collapse. https://guytevet.github.io/mas-page/,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kapon_MAS_Multi-view_Ancestral_Sampling_for_3D_Motion_Generation_Using_2D_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Bilateral Event Mining and Complementary for Event Stream Super-Resolution,"Huang, Zhilin, Liang, Quanmin, Yu, Yijie, Qin, Chujun, Zheng, Xiawu, Huang, Kai, Zhou, Zikun, Yang, Wenming",Event Stream Super-Resolution (ESR) aims to address the challenge of insufficient spatial resolution in event streams which holds great significance for the application of event cameras in complex scenarios. Previous works for ESR often process positive and negative events in a mixed paradigm. This paradigm limits their ability to effectively model the unique characteristics of each event and mutually refine each other by considering their correlations. In this paper we propose a bilateral event mining and complementary network (BMCNet) to fully leverage the potential of each event and capture the shared information to complement each other simultaneously. Specifically we resort to a two-stream network to accomplish comprehensive mining of each type of events individually. To facilitate the exchange of information between two streams we propose a bilateral information exchange (BIE) module. This module is layer-wisely embedded between two streams enabling the effective propagation of hierarchical global information while alleviating the impact of invalid information brought by inherent characteristics of events. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in ESR achieving performance improvements of over 11% on both real and synthetic datasets. Moreover our method significantly enhances the performance of event-based downstream tasks such as object recognition and video reconstruction. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lqm26/BMCNet-ESR.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Huang_Bilateral_Event_Mining_and_Complementary_for_Event_Stream_Super-Resolution_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SANeRF-HQ: Segment Anything for NeRF in High Quality,"Liu, Yichen, Hu, Benran, Tang, Chi-Keung, Tai, Yu-Wing",Recently the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has showcased remarkable capabilities of zero-shot segmentation while NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) has gained popularity as a method for various 3D problems beyond novel view synthesis. Though there exist initial attempts to incorporate these two methods into 3D segmentation they face the challenge of accurately and consistently segmenting objects in complex scenarios. In this paper we introduce the Segment Anything for NeRF in High Quality (SANeRF-HQ) to achieve high-quality 3D segmentation of any target object in a given scene. SANeRF-HQ utilizes SAM for open-world object segmentation guided by user-supplied prompts while leveraging NeRF to aggregate information from different viewpoints. To overcome the aforementioned challenges we employ density field and RGB similarity to enhance the accuracy of segmentation boundary during the aggregation. Emphasizing on segmentation accuracy we evaluate our method on multiple NeRF datasets where high-quality ground-truths are available or manually annotated. SANeRF-HQ shows a significant quality improvement over state-of-the-art methods in NeRF object segmentation provides higher flexibility for object localization and enables more consistent object segmentation across multiple views.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_SANeRF-HQ_Segment_Anything_for_NeRF_in_High_Quality_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Transcending the Limit of Local Window: Advanced Super-Resolution Transformer with Adaptive Token Dictionary,"Zhang, Leheng, Li, Yawei, Zhou, Xingyu, Zhao, Xiaorui, Gu, Shuhang",Single Image Super-Resolution is a classic computer vision problem that involves estimating high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) ones. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) especially Transformers for super-resolution have seen significant advancements in recent years challenges still remain particularly in limited receptive field caused by window-based self-attention. To address these issues we introduce a group of auxiliary Adaptive Token Dictionary to SR Transformer and establish an ATD-SR method. The introduced token dictionary could learn prior information from training data and adapt the learned prior to specific testing image through an adaptive refinement step. The refinement strategy could not only provide global information to all input tokens but also group image tokens into categories. Based on category partitions we further propose a category-based self-attention mechanism designed to leverage distant but similar tokens for enhancing input features. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance on various single image super-resolution benchmarks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Transcending_the_Limit_of_Local_Window_Advanced_Super-Resolution_Transformer_with_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Mixed-Precision Quantization for Federated Learning on Resource-Constrained Heterogeneous Devices,"Chen, Huancheng, Vikalo, Haris",While federated learning (FL) systems often utilize quantization to battle communication and computational bottlenecks they have heretofore been limited to deploying fixed-precision quantization schemes. Meanwhile the concept of mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) where different layers of a deep learning model are assigned varying bit-width remains unexplored in the FL settings. We present a novel FL algorithm FedMPQ which introduces mixed-precision quantization to resource-heterogeneous FL systems. Specifically local models quantized so as to satisfy bit-width constraint are trained by optimizing an objective function that includes a regularization term which promotes reduction of precision in some of the layers without significant performance degradation. The server collects local model updates de-quantizes them into full-precision models and then aggregates them into a global model. To initialize the next round of local training the server relies on the information learned in the previous training round to customize bit-width assignments of the models delivered to different clients. In extensive benchmarking experiments on several model architectures and different datasets in both iid and non-iid settings FedMPQ outperformed the baseline FL schemes that utilize fixed-precision quantization while incurring only a minor computational overhead on the participating devices.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Mixed-Precision_Quantization_for_Federated_Learning_on_Resource-Constrained_Heterogeneous_Devices_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Neural Fields as Distributions: Signal Processing Beyond Euclidean Space,"Rebain, Daniel, Yazdani, Soroosh, Yi, Kwang Moo, Tagliasacchi, Andrea","Neural fields have emerged as a powerful and broadly applicable method for representing signals. However in contrast to classical discrete digital signal processing the portfolio of tools to process such representations is still severely limited and restricted to Euclidean domains. In this paper we address this problem by showing how a probabilistic re-interpretation of neural fields can enable their training and inference processes to become ""filter-aware"". The formulation we propose not only merges training and filtering in an efficient way but also generalizes beyond the familiar Euclidean coordinate spaces to the more general set of smooth manifolds and convolutions induced by the actions of Lie groups. We demonstrate how this framework can enable novel integrations of signal processing techniques for neural field applications on both Euclidean domains such as images and audio as well as non-Euclidean domains such as rotations and rays. A noteworthy benefit of our method is its applicability. Our method can be summarized as primarily a modification of the loss function and in most cases does not require changes to the network architecture or the inference process.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Rebain_Neural_Fields_as_Distributions_Signal_Processing_Beyond_Euclidean_Space_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Style Blind Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation via Covariance Alignment and Semantic Consistence Contrastive Learning,"Ahn, Woo-Jin, Yang, Geun-Yeong, Choi, Hyun-Duck, Lim, Myo-Taeg",Deep learning models for semantic segmentation often experience performance degradation when deployed to unseen target domains unidentified during the training phase. This is mainly due to variations in image texture (i.e. style) from different data sources. To tackle this challenge existing domain generalized semantic segmentation (DGSS) methods attempt to remove style variations from the feature. However these approaches struggle with the entanglement of style and content which may lead to the unintentional removal of crucial content information causing performance degradation. This study addresses this limitation by proposing BlindNet a novel DGSS approach that blinds the style without external modules or datasets. The main idea behind our proposed approach is to alleviate the effect of style in the encoder whilst facilitating robust segmentation in the decoder. To achieve this BlindNet comprises two key components: covariance alignment and semantic consistency contrastive learning. Specifically the covariance alignment trains the encoder to uniformly recognize various styles and preserve the content information of the feature rather than removing the style-sensitive factor. Meanwhile semantic consistency contrastive learning enables the decoder to construct discriminative class embedding space and disentangles features that are vulnerable to misclassification. Through extensive experiments our approach outperforms existing DGSS methods exhibiting robustness and superior performance for semantic segmentation on unseen target domains.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ahn_Style_Blind_Domain_Generalized_Semantic_Segmentation_via_Covariance_Alignment_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
X-3D: Explicit 3D Structure Modeling for Point Cloud Recognition,"Sun, Shuofeng, Rao, Yongming, Lu, Jiwen, Yan, Haibin",Numerous prior studies predominantly emphasize constructing relation vectors for individual neighborhood points and generating dynamic kernels for each vector and embedding these into high-dimensional spaces to capture implicit local structures. However we contend that such implicit high-dimensional structure modeling approch inadequately represents the local geometric structure of point clouds due to the absence of explicit structural information. Hence we introduce X-3D an explicit 3D structure modeling approach. X-3D functions by capturing the explicit local structural information within the input 3D space and employing it to produce dynamic kernels with shared weights for all neighborhood points within the current local region. This modeling approach introduces effective geometric prior and significantly diminishes the disparity between the local structure of the embedding space and the original input point cloud thereby improving the extraction of local features. Experiments show that our method can be used on a variety of methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on segmentation classification detection tasks with lower extra computational cost. Such as 90.7% on ScanObjectNN for classification 79.2% on S3DIS 6 fold and 74.3% on S3DIS Area 5 for segmentation 76.3% on ScanNetV2 for segmentation and 64.5% mAP_ 25  46.9% mAP_ 50  on SUN RGB-D and 69.0% mAP_ 25  51.1% mAP_ 50  on ScanNetV2 .

One More Step: A Versatile Plug-and-Play Module for Rectifying Diffusion Schedule Flaws and Enhancing Low-Frequency Controls,"Hu, Minghui, Zheng, Jianbin, Zheng, Chuanxia, Wang, Chaoyue, Tao, Dacheng, Cham, Tat-Jen",It is well known that many open-released foundational diffusion models have difficulty in generating images that substantially depart from average brightness despite such images being present in the training data. This is due to an inconsistency: while denoising starts from pure Gaussian noise during inference the training noise schedule retains residual data even in the final timestep distribution due to difficulties in numerical conditioning in mainstream formulation leading to unintended bias during inference. To mitigate this issue certain eps-prediction models are combined with an ad-hoc offset-noise methodology. In parallel some contemporary models have adopted zero-terminal SNR noise schedules together with v-prediction which necessitate major alterations to pre-trained models. However such changes risk destabilizing a large multitude of community-driven applications anchored on these pre-trained models. In light of this our investigation revisits the fundamental causes leading to our proposal of an innovative and principled remedy called One More Step (OMS). By integrating a compact network and incorporating an additional simple yet effective step during inference OMS elevates image fidelity and harmonizes the dichotomy between training and inference while preserving original model parameters. Once trained various pre-trained diffusion models with the same latent domain can share the same OMS module.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hu_One_More_Step_A_Versatile_Plug-and-Play_Module_for_Rectifying_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
HIVE: Harnessing Human Feedback for Instructional Visual Editing,"Zhang, Shu, Yang, Xinyi, Feng, Yihao, Qin, Can, Chen, Chia-Chih, Yu, Ning, Chen, Zeyuan, Wang, Huan, Savarese, Silvio, Ermon, Stefano, Xiong, Caiming, Xu, Ran",Incorporating human feedback has been shown to be crucial to align text generated by large language models to human preferences. We hypothesize that state-of-the-art instructional image editing models where outputs are generated based on an input image and an editing instruction could similarly benefit from human feedback as their outputs may not adhere to the correct instructions and preferences of users. In this paper we present a novel framework to harness human feedback for instructional visual editing (HIVE). Specifically we collect human feedback on the edited images and learn a reward function to capture the underlying user preferences. We then introduce scalable diffusion model fine-tuning methods that can incorporate human preferences based on the estimated reward. Besides to mitigate the bias brought by the limitation of data we contribute a new 1.1M training dataset a 3.6K reward dataset for rewards learning and a 1K evaluation dataset to boost the performance of instructional image editing. We conduct extensive empirical experiments quantitatively and qualitatively showing that HIVE is favored over previous state-of-the-art instructional image editing approaches by a large margin.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_HIVE_Harnessing_Human_Feedback_for_Instructional_Visual_Editing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
StrokeFaceNeRF: Stroke-based Facial Appearance Editing in Neural Radiance Field,"Li, Xiao-Juan, Zhang, Dingxi, Chen, Shu-Yu, Liu, Feng-Lin",Current 3D-aware facial NeRF generation approaches control the facial appearance by text lighting conditions or reference images limiting precise manipulation of local facial regions and interactivity. Color stroke a user-friendly and effective tool to depict appearance is challenging to edit 3D faces because of the lack of texture coarse geometry representation and detailed editing operations. To solve the above problems we introduce StrokeFaceNeRF a novel stroke-based method for editing facial NeRF appearance. In order to infer the missing texture and 3D geometry information 2D edited stroke maps are firstly encoded into the EG3D's latent space followed by a transformer-based editing module to achieve effective appearance changes while preserving the original geometry in editing regions. Notably we design a novel geometry loss function to ensure surface density remains consistent during training. To further enhance the local manipulation accuracy we propose a stereo fusion approach which lifts the 2D mask (inferred from strokes or drawn by users) into 3D mask volume allowing explicit blending of the original and edited faces. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed method outperforms existing 2D and 3D methods in both editing reality and geometry retention.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_StrokeFaceNeRF_Stroke-based_Facial_Appearance_Editing_in_Neural_Radiance_Field_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ProxyCap: Real-time Monocular Full-body Capture in World Space via Human-Centric Proxy-to-Motion Learning,"Zhang, Yuxiang, Zhang, Hongwen, Hu, Liangxiao, Zhang, Jiajun, Yi, Hongwei, Zhang, Shengping, Liu, Yebin",Learning-based approaches to monocular motion capture have recently shown promising results by learning to regress in a data-driven manner. However due to the challenges in data collection and network designs it remains challenging to achieve real-time full-body capture while being accurate in world space. In this work we introduce ProxyCap a human-centric proxy-to-motion learning scheme to learn world-space motions from a proxy dataset of 2D skeleton sequences and 3D rotational motions. Such proxy data enables us to build a learning-based network with accurate world-space supervision while also mitigating the generalization issues. For more accurate and physically plausible predictions in world space our network is designed to learn human motions from a human-centric perspective which enables the understanding of the same motion captured with different camera trajectories. Moreover a contact-aware neural motion descent module is proposed to improve foot-ground contact and motion misalignment with the proxy observations. With the proposed learning-based solution we demonstrate the first real-time monocular full-body capture system with plausible foot-ground contact in world space even using hand-held cameras.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_ProxyCap_Real-time_Monocular_Full-body_Capture_in_World_Space_via_Human-Centric_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
On the Robustness of Language Guidance for Low-Level Vision Tasks: Findings from Depth Estimation,"Chatterjee, Agneet, Gokhale, Tejas, Baral, Chitta, Yang, Yezhou","Recent advances in monocular depth estimation have been made by incorporating natural language as additional guidance. Although yielding impressive results the impact of the language prior particularly in terms of generalization and robustness remains unexplored. In this paper we address this gap by quantifying the impact of this prior and introduce methods to benchmark its effectiveness across various settings. We generate ""low-level"" sentences that convey object-centric three-dimensional spatial relationships incorporate them as additional language priors and evaluate their downstream impact on depth estimation. Our key finding is that current language-guided depth estimators perform optimally only with scene-level descriptions and counter-intuitively fare worse with low level descriptions. Despite leveraging additional data these methods are not robust to directed adversarial attacks and decline in performance with an increase in distribution shift. Finally to provide a foundation for future research we identify points of failures and offer insights to better understand these shortcomings. With an increasing number of methods using language for depth estimation our findings highlight the opportunities and pitfalls that require careful consideration for effective deployment in real-world settings.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chatterjee_On_the_Robustness_of_Language_Guidance_for_Low-Level_Vision_Tasks_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
UFOGen: You Forward Once Large Scale Text-to-Image Generation via Diffusion GANs,"Xu, Yanwu, Zhao, Yang, Xiao, Zhisheng, Hou, Tingbo",Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in transforming text prompts into coherent images yet the computational cost of the multi-step inference remains a persistent challenge. To address this issue we present UFOGen a novel generative model designed for ultra-fast one-step text-to-image generation. In contrast to conventional approaches that focus on improving samplers or employing distillation techniques for diffusion models UFOGen adopts a hybrid methodology integrating diffusion models with a GAN objective. Leveraging a newly introduced diffusion-GAN objective and initialization with pre-trained diffusion models UFOGen excels in efficiently generating high-quality images conditioned on textual descriptions in a single step. Beyond traditional text-to-image generation UFOGen showcases versatility in applications. Notably UFOGen stands among the pioneering models enabling one-step text-to-image generation and diverse downstream tasks presenting a significant advancement in the landscape of efficient generative models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_UFOGen_You_Forward_Once_Large_Scale_Text-to-Image_Generation_via_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
A Dual-Augmentor Framework for Domain Generalization in 3D Human Pose Estimation,"Peng, Qucheng, Zheng, Ce, Chen, Chen",3D human pose data collected in controlled laboratory settings present challenges for pose estimators that generalize across diverse scenarios. To address this domain generalization is employed. Current methodologies in domain generalization for 3D human pose estimation typically utilize adversarial training to generate synthetic poses for training. Nonetheless these approaches exhibit several limitations. First the lack of prior information about the target domain complicates the application of suitable augmentation through a single pose augmentor affecting generalization on target domains. Moreover adversarial training's discriminator tends to enforce similarity between source and synthesized poses impeding the exploration of out-of-source distributions. Furthermore the pose estimator's optimization is not exposed to domain shifts limiting its overall generalization ability. To address these limitations we propose a novel framework featuring two pose augmentors: the weak and the strong augmentors. Our framework employs differential strategies for generation and discrimination processes facilitating the preservation of knowledge related to source poses and the exploration of out-of-source distributions without prior information about target poses. Besides we leverage meta-optimization to simulate domain shifts in the optimization process of the pose estimator thereby improving its generalization ability. Our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods as demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Peng_A_Dual-Augmentor_Framework_for_Domain_Generalization_in_3D_Human_Pose_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ACT-Diffusion: Efficient Adversarial Consistency Training for One-step Diffusion Models,"Kong, Fei, Duan, Jinhao, Sun, Lichao, Cheng, Hao, Xu, Renjing, Shen, Hengtao, Zhu, Xiaofeng, Shi, Xiaoshuang, Xu, Kaidi",Though diffusion models excel in image generation their step-by-step denoising leads to slow generation speeds. Consistency training addresses this issue with single-step sampling but often produces lower-quality generations and requires high training costs. In this paper we show that optimizing consistency training loss minimizes the Wasserstein distance between target and generated distributions. As timestep increases the upper bound accumulates previous consistency training losses. Therefore larger batch sizes are needed to reduce both current and accumulated losses. We propose Adversarial Consistency Training (ACT) which directly minimizes the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between distributions at each timestep using a discriminator. Theoretically ACT enhances generation quality and convergence. By incorporating a discriminator into the consistency training framework our method achieves improved FID scores on CIFAR10 and ImageNet 64x64 and LSUN Cat 256x256 datasets retains zero-shot image inpainting capabilities and uses less than 1/6 of the original batch size and fewer than 1/2 of the model parameters and training steps compared to the baseline method this leads to a substantial reduction in resource consumption.

Spectral Meets Spatial: Harmonising 3D Shape Matching and Interpolation,"Cao, Dongliang, Eisenberger, Marvin, El Amrani, Nafie, Cremers, Daniel, Bernard, Florian",Although 3D shape matching and interpolation are highly interrelated they are often studied separately and applied sequentially to relate different 3D shapes thus resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this work we present a unified framework to predict both point-wise correspondences and shape interpolation between 3D shapes. To this end we combine the deep functional map framework with classical surface deformation models to map shapes in both spectral and spatial domains. On the one hand by incorporating spatial maps our method obtains more accurate and smooth point-wise correspondences compared to previous functional map methods for shape matching. On the other hand by introducing spectral maps our method gets rid of commonly used but computationally expensive geodesic distance constraints that are only valid for near-isometric shape deformations. Furthermore we propose a novel test-time adaptation scheme to capture both pose-dominant and shape-dominant deformations. Using different challenging datasets we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for both shape matching and interpolation even compared to supervised approaches.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cao_Spectral_Meets_Spatial_Harmonising_3D_Shape_Matching_and_Interpolation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Emu Edit: Precise Image Editing via Recognition and Generation Tasks,"Sheynin, Shelly, Polyak, Adam, Singer, Uriel, Kirstain, Yuval, Zohar, Amit, Ashual, Oron, Parikh, Devi, Taigman, Yaniv",Instruction-based image editing holds immense potential for a variety of applications as it enables users to perform any editing operation using a natural language instruction. However current models in this domain often struggle with accurately executing user instructions. We present Emu Edit a multi-task image editing model which sets state-of-the-art results in instruction-based image editing. To develop Emu Edit we train it to multi-task across an unprecedented range of tasks such as region-based editing free-form editing and Computer Vision tasks all of which are formulated as generative tasks. Additionally to enhance Emu Edit's multi-task learning abilities we provide it with learned task embeddings which guide the generation process towards the correct edit type. Both these elements are essential for Emu Edit's outstanding performance. Furthermore we show that Emu Edit can generalize to new tasks such as image inpainting super-resolution and compositions of editing tasks with just a few labeled examples. This capability offers a significant advantage in scenarios where high-quality samples are scarce. Lastly to facilitate a more rigorous and informed assessment of instructable image editing models we release a new challenging and versatile benchmark that includes seven different image editing tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sheynin_Emu_Edit_Precise_Image_Editing_via_Recognition_and_Generation_Tasks_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Face2Diffusion for Fast and Editable Face Personalization,"Shiohara, Kaede, Yamasaki, Toshihiko",Face personalization aims to insert specific faces taken from images into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. However it is still challenging for previous methods to preserve both the identity similarity and editability due to overfitting to training samples. In this paper we propose Face2Diffusion (F2D) for high-editability face personalization. The core idea behind F2D is that removing identity-irrelevant information from the training pipeline prevents the overfitting problem and improves editability of encoded faces. F2D consists of the following three novel components: 1) Multi-scale identity encoder provides well-disentangled identity features while keeping the benefits of multi-scale information which improves the diversity of camera poses. 2) Expression guidance disentangles face expressions from identities and improves the controllability of face expressions. 3) Class-guided denoising regularization encourages models to learn how faces should be denoised which boosts the text-alignment of backgrounds. Extensive experiments on the FaceForensics++ dataset and diverse prompts demonstrate our method greatly improves the trade-off between the identity- and text-fidelity compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Dancing with Still Images: Video Distillation via Static-Dynamic Disentanglement,"Wang, Ziyu, Xu, Yue, Lu, Cewu, Li, Yong-Lu",Recently dataset distillation has paved the way towards efficient machine learning especially for image datasets. However the distillation for videos characterized by an exclusive temporal dimension remains an underexplored domain. In this work we provide the first systematic study of video distillation and introduce a taxonomy to categorize temporal compression. Our investigation reveals that the temporal information is usually not well learned during distillation and the temporal dimension of synthetic data contributes little. The observations motivate our unified framework of disentangling the dynamic and static information in the videos. It first distills the videos into still images as static memory and then compensates the dynamic and motion information with a learnable dynamic memory block. Our method achieves state-of-the-art on video datasets at different scales with notably smaller memory storage budget.

UniRepLKNet: A Universal Perception Large-Kernel ConvNet for Audio Video Point Cloud Time-Series and Image Recognition,"Ding, Xiaohan, Zhang, Yiyuan, Ge, Yixiao, Zhao, Sijie, Song, Lin, Yue, Xiangyu, Shan, Ying",Large-kernel convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have recently received extensive research attention but two unresolved and critical issues demand further investigation. 1) The architectures of existing large-kernel ConvNets largely follow the design principles of conventional ConvNets or transformers while the architectural design for large-kernel ConvNets remains under-addressed. 2) As transformers have dominated multiple modalities it remains to be investigated whether ConvNets also have a strong universal perception ability in domains beyond vision. In this paper we contribute from two aspects. 1) We propose four architectural guidelines for designing large-kernel ConvNets the core of which is to exploit the essential characteristics of large kernels that distinguish them from small kernels - they can see wide without going deep. Following such guidelines our proposed large-kernel ConvNet shows leading performance in image recognition (ImageNet accuracy of 88.0% ADE20K mIoU of 55.6% and COCO box AP of 56.4%) demonstrating better performance and higher speed than the recent powerful competitors. 2) We discover large kernels are the key to unlocking the exceptional performance of ConvNets in domains where they were originally not proficient. With certain modality-related preprocessing approaches the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on time-series forecasting and audio recognition tasks even without modality-specific customization to the architecture. All the code and models are publicly available on GitHub and Huggingface.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ding_UniRepLKNet_A_Universal_Perception_Large-Kernel_ConvNet_for_Audio_Video_Point_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
SwiftBrush: One-Step Text-to-Image Diffusion Model with Variational Score Distillation,"Nguyen, Thuan Hoang, Tran, Anh",Despite their ability to generate high-resolution and diverse images from text prompts text-to-image diffusion models often suffer from slow iterative sampling processes. Model distillation is one of the most effective directions to accelerate these models. However previous distillation methods fail to retain the generation quality while requiring a significant amount of images for training either from real data or synthetically generated by the teacher model. In response to this limitation we present a novel image-free distillation scheme named SwiftBrush. Drawing inspiration from text-to-3D synthesis in which a 3D neural radiance field that aligns with the input prompt can be obtained from a 2D text-to-image diffusion prior via a specialized loss without the use of any 3D data ground-truth our approach re-purposes that same loss for distilling a pretrained multi-step text-to-image model to a student network that can generate high-fidelity images with just a single inference step. In spite of its simplicity our model stands as one of the first one-step text-to-image generators that can produce images of comparable quality to Stable Diffusion without reliance on any training image data.

DEADiff: An Efficient Stylization Diffusion Model with Disentangled Representations,"Qi, Tianhao, Fang, Shancheng, Wu, Yanze, Xie, Hongtao, Liu, Jiawei, Chen, Lang, He, Qian, Zhang, Yongdong",The diffusion-based text-to-image model harbors immense potential in transferring reference style. However current encoder-based approaches significantly impair the text controllability of text-to-image models while transferring styles. In this paper we introduce DEADiff to address this issue using the following two strategies: 1) a mechanism to decouple the style and semantics of reference images. The decoupled feature representations are first extracted by Q-Formers which are instructed by different text descriptions. Then they are injected into mutually exclusive subsets of cross-attention layers for better disentanglement. 2) A non-reconstructive learning method. The Q-Formers are trained using paired images rather than the identical target in which the reference image and the ground-truth image are with the same style or semantics. We show that DEADiff attains the best visual stylization results and optimal balance between the text controllability inherent in the text-to-image model and style similarity to the reference image as demonstrated both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Exact Fusion via Feature Distribution Matching for Few-shot Image Generation,"Zhou, Yingbo, Ye, Yutong, Zhang, Pengyu, Wei, Xian, Chen, Mingsong",Few-shot image generation as an important yet challenging visual task still suffers from the trade-off between generation quality and diversity. According to the principle of feature-matching learning existing fusion-based methods usually fuse different features by using similarity measurements or attention mechanisms which may match features inaccurately and lead to artifacts in the texture and structure of generated images. In this paper we propose an exact Fusion via Feature Distribution matching Generative Adversarial Network (F2DGAN) for few-shot image generation. The rationale behind this is that feature distribution matching is much more reliable than feature matching to explore the statistical characters in image feature space for limited real-world data. To model feature distributions from only a few examples for feature fusion we design a novel variational feature distribution matching fusion module to perform exact fusion by empirical cumulative distribution functions. Specifically we employ a variational autoencoder to transform deep image features into distributions and fuse different features exactly by applying histogram matching. Additionally we formulate two effective losses to guide the matching process for better fitting our fusion strategy. Extensive experiments compared with state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of F2DGAN for few-shot image generation in terms of generation quality and diversity and the effectiveness of data augmentation in downstream classification tasks.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_Exact_Fusion_via_Feature_Distribution_Matching_for_Few-shot_Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CoDeF: Content Deformation Fields for Temporally Consistent Video Processing,"Ouyang, Hao, Wang, Qiuyu, Xiao, Yuxi, Bai, Qingyan, Zhang, Juntao, Zheng, Kecheng, Zhou, Xiaowei, Chen, Qifeng, Shen, Yujun",We present the content deformation field (CoDeF) as a new type of video representation which consists of a canonical content field aggregating the static contents in the entire video and a temporal deformation field recording the transformations from the canonical image (i.e. rendered from the canonical content field) to each individual frame along the time axis. Given a target video these two fields are jointly optimized to reconstruct it through a carefully tailored rendering pipeline. We advisedly introduce some regularizations into the optimization process urging the canonical content field to inherit semantics (e.g. the object shape) from the video. With such a design CoDeF naturally supports lifting image algorithms for video processing in the sense that one can apply an image algorithm to the canonical image and effortlessly propagate the outcomes to the entire video with the aid of the temporal deformation field. We experimentally show that CoDeF is able to lift image-to-image translation to video-to-video translation and lift keypoint detection to keypoint tracking without any training. More importantly thanks to our lifting strategy that deploys the algorithms on only one image we achieve superior cross-frame consistency in processed videos compared to existing video-to-video translation approaches and even manage to track non-rigid objects like water and smog. Code will be made publicly available.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ouyang_CoDeF_Content_Deformation_Fields_for_Temporally_Consistent_Video_Processing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
QUADify: Extracting Meshes with Pixel-level Details and Materials from Images,"Fr√ºhauf, Maximilian, Riemenschneider, Hayko, Gross, Markus, Schroers, Christopher",Despite exciting progress in automatic 3D reconstruction from images excessive and irregular triangular faces in the resulting meshes still constitute a significant challenge when it comes to adoption in practical artist workflows. Therefore we propose a method to extract regular quad-dominant meshes from posed images. More specifically we generate a high-quality 3D model through decomposition into an easily editable quad-dominant mesh with pixel-level details such as displacement materials and lighting. To enable end-to-end learning of shape and quad topology we QUADify a neural implicit representation using our novel differentiable re-meshing objective. Distinct from previous work our method exploits artifact-free Catmull-Clark subdivision combined with vertex displacement to extract pixel-level details linked to the base geometry. Finally we apply differentiable rendering techniques for material and lighting decomposition to optimize for image reconstruction. Our experiments show the benefits of end-to-end re-meshing and that our method yields state-of-the-art geometric accuracy while providing lightweight meshes with displacements and textures that are directly compatible with professional renderers and game engines.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Fruhauf_QUADify_Extracting_Meshes_with_Pixel-level_Details_and_Materials_from_Images_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
RecDiffusion: Rectangling for Image Stitching with Diffusion Models,"Zhou, Tianhao, Li, Haipeng, Wang, Ziyi, Luo, Ao, Zhang, Chen-Lin, Li, Jiajun, Zeng, Bing, Liu, Shuaicheng",Image stitching from different captures often results in non-rectangular boundaries which is often considered unappealing. To solve non-rectangular boundaries current solutions involve cropping which discards image content inpainting which can introduce unrelated content or warping which can distort non-linear features and introduce artifacts. To overcome these issues we introduce a novel diffusion-based learning framework RecDiffusion for image stitching rectangling. This framework combines Motion Diffusion Models (MDM) to generate motion fields effectively transitioning from the stitched image's irregular borders to a geometrically corrected intermediary. Followed by Content Diffusion Models (CDM) for image detail refinement. Notably our sampling process utilizes a weighted map to identify regions needing correction during each iteration of CDM. Our RecDiffusion ensures geometric accuracy and overall visual appeal surpassing all previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative measures when evaluated on public benchmarks. Code is released at https://github.com/lhaippp/RecDiffusion.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_RecDiffusion_Rectangling_for_Image_Stitching_with_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Eclipse: Disambiguating Illumination and Materials using Unintended Shadows,"Verbin, Dor, Mildenhall, Ben, Hedman, Peter, Barron, Jonathan T., Zickler, Todd, Srinivasan, Pratul P.",Decomposing an object's appearance into representations of its materials and the surrounding illumination is difficult even when the object's 3D shape is known beforehand. This problem is especially challenging for diffuse objects: it is ill-conditioned because diffuse materials severely blur incoming light and it is ill-posed because diffuse materials under high-frequency lighting can be indistinguishable from shiny materials under low-frequency lighting. We show that it is possible to recover precise materials and illumination---even from diffuse objects---by exploiting unintended shadows like the ones cast onto an object by the photographer who moves around it. These shadows are a nuisance in most previous inverse rendering pipelines but here we exploit them as signals that improve conditioning and help resolve material-lighting ambiguities. We present a method based on differentiable Monte Carlo ray tracing that uses images of an object to jointly recover its spatially-varying materials the surrounding illumination environment and the shapes of the unseen light occluders who inadvertently cast shadows upon it.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Verbin_Eclipse_Disambiguating_Illumination_and_Materials_using_Unintended_Shadows_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Balancing Act: Distribution-Guided Debiasing in Diffusion Models,"Parihar, Rishubh, Bhat, Abhijnya, Basu, Abhipsa, Mallick, Saswat, Kundu, Jogendra Nath, Babu, R. Venkatesh",Diffusion Models (DMs) have emerged as powerful generative models with unprecedented image generation capability. These models are widely used for data augmentation and creative applications. However DMs reflect the biases present in the training datasets. This is especially concerning in the context of faces where the DM prefers one demographic subgroup vs others (eg. female vs male). In this work we present a method for debiasing DMs without relying on additional reference data or model retraining. Specifically we propose Distribution Guidance which enforces the generated images to follow the prescribed attribute distribution. To realize this we build on the key insight that the latent features of denoising UNet hold rich demographic semantics and the same can be leveraged to guide debiased generation. We train Attribute Distribution Predictor (ADP) - a small mlp that maps the latent features to the distribution of attributes. ADP is trained with pseudo labels generated from existing attribute classifiers. The proposed Distribution Guidance with ADP enables us to do fair generation. Our method reduces bias across single/multiple attributes and outperforms the baseline by a significant margin for unconditional and text-conditional diffusion models. Further we present a downstream task of training a fair attribute classifier by augmenting the training set with our generated data.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Parihar_Balancing_Act_Distribution-Guided_Debiasing_in_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Differentiable Point-based Inverse Rendering,"Chung, Hoon-Gyu, Choi, Seokjun, Baek, Seung-Hwan",We present differentiable point-based inverse rendering DPIR an analysis-by-synthesis method that processes images captured under diverse illuminations to estimate shape and spatially-varying BRDF. To this end we adopt point-based rendering eliminating the need for multiple samplings per ray typical of volumetric rendering thus significantly enhancing the speed of inverse rendering. To realize this idea we devise a hybrid point-volumetric representation for geometry and a regularized basis-BRDF representation for reflectance. The hybrid geometric representation enables fast rendering through point-based splatting while retaining the geometric details and stability inherent to SDF-based representations. The regularized basis-BRDF mitigates the ill-posedness of inverse rendering stemming from limited light-view angular samples. We also propose an efficient shadow detection method using point-based shadow map rendering. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that DPIR outperforms prior works in terms of reconstruction accuracy computational efficiency and memory footprint. Furthermore our explicit point-based representation and rendering enables intuitive geometry and reflectance editing.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chung_Differentiable_Point-based_Inverse_Rendering_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
A Unified and Interpretable Emotion Representation and Expression Generation,"Paskaleva, Reni, Holubakha, Mykyta, Ilic, Andela, Motamed, Saman, Van Gool, Luc, Paudel, Danda",Canonical emotions such as happy sad and fear are easy to understand and annotate. However emotions are often compound e.g. happily surprised and can be mapped to the action units (AUs) used for expressing emotions and trivially to the canonical ones. Intuitively emotions are continuous as represented by the arousal-valence (AV) model. An interpretable unification of these four modalities --namely Canonical Compound AUs and AV-- is highly desirable for a better representation and understanding of emotions. However such unification remains to be unknown in the current literature. In this work we propose an interpretable and unified emotion model referred as C2A2. We also develop a method that leverages labels of the non-unified models to annotate the novel unified one. Finally we modify the text-conditional diffusion models to understand continuous numbers which are then used to generate continuous expressions using our unified emotion model. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments we show that our generated images are rich and capture subtle expressions. Our work allows a fine-grained generation of expressions in conjunction with other textual inputs and offers a new label space for emotions at the same time.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Paskaleva_A_Unified_and_Interpretable_Emotion_Representation_and_Expression_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Upscale-A-Video: Temporal-Consistent Diffusion Model for Real-World Video Super-Resolution,"Zhou, Shangchen, Yang, Peiqing, Wang, Jianyi, Luo, Yihang, Loy, Chen Change",Text-based diffusion models have exhibited remarkable success in generation and editing showing great promise for enhancing visual content with their generative prior. However applying these models to video super-resolution remains challenging due to the high demands for output fidelity and temporal consistency which is complicated by the inherent randomness in diffusion models. Our study introduces Upscale-A-Video a text-guided latent diffusion framework for video upscaling. This framework ensures temporal coherence through two key mechanisms: locally it integrates temporal layers into U-Net and VAE-Decoder maintaining consistency within short sequences; globally without training a flow-guided recurrent latent propagation module is introduced to enhance overall video stability by propagating and fusing latent across the entire sequences. Thanks to the diffusion paradigm our model also offers greater flexibility by allowing text prompts to guide texture creation and adjustable noise levels to balance restoration and generation enabling a trade-off between fidelity and quality. Extensive experiments show that Upscale-A-Video surpasses existing methods in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks as well as in AI-generated videos showcasing impressive visual realism and temporal consistency.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_Upscale-A-Video_Temporal-Consistent_Diffusion_Model_for_Real-World_Video_Super-Resolution_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
4D-DRESS: A 4D Dataset of Real-World Human Clothing With Semantic Annotations,"Wang, Wenbo, Ho, Hsuan-I, Guo, Chen, Rong, Boxiang, Grigorev, Artur, Song, Jie, Zarate, Juan Jose, Hilliges, Otmar",The studies of human clothing for digital avatars have predominantly relied on synthetic datasets. While easy to collect synthetic data often fall short in realism and fail to capture authentic clothing dynamics. Addressing this gap we introduce 4D-DRESS the first real-world 4D dataset advancing human clothing research with its high-quality 4D textured scans and garment meshes. 4D-DRESS captures 64 outfits in 520 human motion sequences amounting to 78k textured scans. Creating a real-world clothing dataset is challenging particularly in annotating and segmenting the extensive and complex 4D human scans. To address this we develop a semi-automatic 4D human parsing pipeline. We efficiently combine a human-in-the-loop process with automation to accurately label 4D scans in diverse garments and body movements. Leveraging precise annotations and high-quality garment meshes we establish several benchmarks for clothing simulation and reconstruction. 4D-DRESS offers realistic and challenging data that complements synthetic sources paving the way for advancements in research of lifelike human clothing.

Specularity Factorization for Low-Light Enhancement,"Saini, Saurabh, Narayanan, P J",We present a new additive image factorization technique that treats images to be composed of multiple latent specular components which can be simply estimated recursively by modulating the sparsity during decomposition. Our model-driven RSFNet estimates these factors by unrolling the optimization into network layers requiring only a few scalars to be learned. The resultant factors are interpretable by design and can be fused for different image enhancement tasks via a network or combined directly by the user in a controllable fashion. Based on RSFNet we detail a zero-reference Low Light Enhancement (LLE) application trained without paired or unpaired supervision. Our system improves the state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and achieves better generalization on multiple other datasets. We also integrate our factors with other task specific fusion networks for applications like deraining deblurring and dehazing with negligible overhead thereby highlighting the multi-domain and multi-task generalizability of our proposed RSFNet. The code and data is released for reproducibility on the project homepage.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Saini_Specularity_Factorization_for_Low-Light_Enhancement_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Paint3D: Paint Anything 3D with Lighting-Less Texture Diffusion Models,"Zeng, Xianfang, Chen, Xin, Qi, Zhongqi, Liu, Wen, Zhao, Zibo, Wang, Zhibin, Fu, Bin, Liu, Yong, Yu, Gang",This paper presents Paint3D a novel coarse-to-fine generative framework that is capable of producing high-resolution lighting-less and diverse 2K UV texture maps for untextured 3D meshes conditioned on text or image inputs. The key challenge addressed is generating high-quality textures without embedded illumination information which allows the textures to be re-lighted or re-edited within modern graphics pipelines. To achieve this our method first leverages a pre-trained depth-aware 2D diffusion model to generate view-conditional images and perform multi-view texture fusion producing an initial coarse texture map. However as 2D models cannot fully represent 3D shapes and disable lighting effects the coarse texture map exhibits incomplete areas and illumination artifacts. To resolve this we train separate UV Inpainting and UVHD diffusion models specialized for the shape-aware refinement of incomplete areas and the removal of illumination artifacts. Through this coarse-to-fine process Paint3D can produce high-quality 2K UV textures that maintain semantic consistency while being lighting-less significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in texturing 3D objects.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zeng_Paint3D_Paint_Anything_3D_with_Lighting-Less_Texture_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MS-MANO: Enabling Hand Pose Tracking with Biomechanical Constraints,"Xie, Pengfei, Xu, Wenqiang, Tang, Tutian, Yu, Zhenjun, Lu, Cewu",This work proposes a novel learning framework for visual hand dynamics analysis that takes into account the physiological aspects of hand motion. The existing models which are simplified joint-actuated systems often produce unnatural motions. To address this we integrate a musculoskeletal system with a learnable parametric hand model MANO to create a new model MS-MANO. This model emulates the dynamics of muscles and tendons to drive the skeletal system imposing physiologically realistic constraints on the resulting torque trajectories. We further propose a simulation-in-the-loop pose refinement framework BioPR that refines the initial estimated pose through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network. Our evaluation of the accuracy of MS-MANO and the efficacy of the BioPR is conducted in two separate parts. The accuracy of MS-MANO is compared with MyoSuite while the efficacy of BioPR is benchmarked against two large-scale public datasets and two recent state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xie_MS-MANO_Enabling_Hand_Pose_Tracking_with_Biomechanical_Constraints_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Generate Like Experts: Multi-Stage Font Generation by Incorporating Font Transfer Process into Diffusion Models,"Fu, Bin, Yu, Fanghua, Liu, Anran, Wang, Zixuan, Wen, Jie, He, Junjun, Qiao, Yu",Few-shot font generation (FFG) produces stylized font images with a limited number of reference samples which can significantly reduce labor costs in manual font designs. Most existing FFG methods follow the style-content disentanglement paradigm and employ the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate target fonts by combining the decoupled content and style representations. The complicated structure and detailed style are simultaneously generated in those methods which may be the sub-optimal solutions for FFG task. Inspired by most manual font design processes of expert designers in this paper we model font generation as a multi-stage generative process. Specifically as the injected noise and the data distribution in diffusion models can be well-separated into different sub-spaces we are able to incorporate the font transfer process into these models. Based on this observation we generalize diffusion methods to model font generative process by separating the reverse diffusion process into three stages with different functions: The structure construction stage first generates the structure information for the target character based on the source image and the font transfer stage subsequently transforms the source font to the target font. Finally the font refinement stage enhances the appearances and local details of the target font images. Based on the above multi-stage generative process we construct our font generation framework named MSD-Font with a dual-network approach to generate font images. The superior performance demonstrates the effectiveness of our model. The code is available at: https://github.com/fubinfb/MSD-Font .,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Fu_Generate_Like_Experts_Multi-Stage_Font_Generation_by_Incorporating_Font_Transfer_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Diffuse Attend and Segment: Unsupervised Zero-Shot Segmentation using Stable Diffusion,"Tian, Junjiao, Aggarwal, Lavisha, Colaco, Andrea, Kira, Zsolt, Gonzalez-Franco, Mar",Producing quality segmentation masks for images is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Recent research has explored large-scale supervised training to enable zero-shot transfer segmentation on virtually any image style and unsupervised training to enable segmentation without dense annotations. However constructing a model capable of segmenting anything in a zero-shot manner without any annotations is still challenging. In this paper we propose to utilize the self-attention layers in stable diffusion models to achieve this goal because the pre-trained stable diffusion model has learned inherent concepts of objects within its attention layers. Specifically we introduce a simple yet effective iterative merging process based on measuring KL divergence among attention maps to merge them into valid segmentation masks. The proposed method does not require any training or language dependency to extract quality segmentation for any images. On COCO-Stuff-27 our method surpasses the prior unsupervised zero-shot transfer SOTA method by an absolute 26% in pixel accuracy and 17% in mean IoU.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Tian_Diffuse_Attend_and_Segment_Unsupervised_Zero-Shot_Segmentation_using_Stable_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Implicit Discriminative Knowledge Learning for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification,"Ren, Kaijie, Zhang, Lei",Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging cross-modal pedestrian retrieval task due to significant intra-class variations and cross-modal discrepancies among different cameras. Existing works mainly focus on embedding images of different modalities into a unified space to mine modality-shared features. They only seek distinctive information within these shared features while ignoring the identity-aware useful information that is implicit in the modality-specific features. To address this issue we propose a novel Implicit Discriminative Knowledge Learning (IDKL) network to uncover and leverage the implicit discriminative information contained within the modality-specific. First we extract modality-specific and modality-shared features using a novel dual-stream network. Then the modality-specific features undergo purification to reduce their modality style discrepancies while preserving identity-aware discriminative knowledge. Subsequently this kind of implicit knowledge is distilled into the modality-shared feature to enhance its distinctiveness. Finally an alignment loss is proposed to minimize modality discrepancy on enhanced modality-shared features. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the superiority of IDKL network over the state-of-the-art methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ren_Implicit_Discriminative_Knowledge_Learning_for_Visible-Infrared_Person_Re-Identification_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Gradient Alignment for Cross-Domain Face Anti-Spoofing,"Le, Binh M., Woo, Simon S.",Recent advancements in domain generalization (DG) for face anti-spoofing (FAS) have garnered considerable attention. Traditional methods have focused on designing learning objectives and additional modules to isolate domain-specific features while retaining domain-invariant characteristics in their representations. However such approaches often lack guarantees of consistent maintenance of domain-invariant features or the complete removal of domain-specific features. Furthermore most prior works of DG for FAS do not ensure convergence to a local flat minimum which has been shown to be advantageous for DG. In this paper we introduce GAC-FAS a novel learning objective that encourages the model to converge towards an optimal flat minimum without necessitating additional learning modules. Unlike conventional sharpness-aware minimizers GAC-FAS identifies ascending points for each domain and regulates the generalization gradient updates at these points to align coherently with empirical risk minimization (ERM) gradient updates. This unique approach specifically guides the model to be robust against domain shifts. We demonstrate the efficacy of GAC-FAS through rigorous testing on challenging cross-domain FAS datasets where it establishes state-of-the-art performance.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Le_Gradient_Alignment_for_Cross-Domain_Face_Anti-Spoofing_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
OpticalDR: A Deep Optical Imaging Model for Privacy-Protective Depression Recognition,"Pan, Yuchen, Jiang, Junjun, Jiang, Kui, Wu, Zhihao, Yu, Keyuan, Liu, Xianming",Depression Recognition (DR) poses a considerable challenge especially in the context of the growing concerns surrounding privacy. Traditional automatic diagnosis of DR technology necessitates the use of facial images undoubtedly expose the patient identity features and poses privacy risks. In order to mitigate the potential risks associated with the inappropriate disclosure of patient facial images we design a new imaging system to erase the identity information of captured facial images while retain disease-relevant features. It is irreversible for identity information recovery while preserving essential disease-related characteristics necessary for accurate DR. More specifically we try to record a de-identified facial image (erasing the identifiable features as much as possible) by a learnable lens which is optimized in conjunction with the following DR task as well as a range of face analysis related auxiliary tasks in an end-to-end manner. These aforementioned strategies form our final Optical deep Depression Recognition network (OpticalDR). Experiments on CelebA AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014 datasets demonstrate that our OpticalDR has achieved state-of-the-art privacy protection performance with an average AUC of 0.51 on popular facial recognition models and competitive results for DR with MAE/RMSE of 7.53/8.48 on AVEC 2013 and 7.89/8.82 on AVEC 2014 respectively.

Observation-Guided Diffusion Probabilistic Models,"Kang, Junoh, Choi, Jinyoung, Choi, Sungik, Han, Bohyung",We propose a novel diffusion-based image generation method called the observation-guided diffusion probabilistic model (OGDM) which effectively addresses the tradeoff between quality control and fast sampling. Our approach reestablishes the training objective by integrating the guidance of the observation process with the Markov chain in a principled way. This is achieved by introducing an additional loss term derived from the observation based on a conditional discriminator on noise level which employs a Bernoulli distribution indicating whether its input lies on the (noisy) real manifold or not. This strategy allows us to optimize the more accurate negative log-likelihood induced in the inference stage especially when the number of function evaluations is limited. The proposed training scheme is also advantageous even when incorporated only into the fine-tuning process and it is compatible with various fast inference strategies since our method yields better denoising networks using the exactly the same inference procedure without incurring extra computational cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our training algorithm using diverse inference techniques on strong diffusion model baselines. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Junoh-Kang/OGDM_edm.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kang_Observation-Guided_Diffusion_Probabilistic_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Spatial-Aware Regression for Keypoint Localization,"Wang, Dongkai, Zhang, Shiliang",Regression-based keypoint localization shows advantages of high efficiency and better robustness to quantization errors than heatmap-based methods. However existing regression-based methods discard the spatial location prior in input image with a global pooling leading to inferior accuracy and are limited to single instance localization tasks. We study the regression-based keypoint localization from a new perspective by leveraging the spatial location prior. Instead of regressing on the pooled feature the proposed Spatial-Aware Regression (SAR) maintains the spatial location map and outputs spatial coordinates and confidence score for each grid which are optimized with a unified objective. Benefited by the location prior these spatial-aware outputs can be efficiently optimized resulting in better localization performance. Moreover incorporating spatial prior makes SAR more general and can be applied into various keypoint localization tasks. We test the proposed method in 4 keypoint localization tasks including single/multi-person 2D/3D pose estimation and the whole-body pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate its promising performance e.g. consistently outperforming recent regressions-based methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Spatial-Aware_Regression_for_Keypoint_Localization_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
EFormer: Enhanced Transformer towards Semantic-Contour Features of Foreground for Portraits Matting,"Wang, Zitao, Miao, Qiguang, Xi, Yue, Zhao, Peipei",The portrait matting task aims to extract an alpha matte with complete semantics and finely detailed contours. In comparison to CNN-based approaches transformers with self-attention module have a better capacity to capture long-range dependencies and low-frequency semantic information of a portrait. However recent research shows that the self-attention mechanism struggles with modeling high-frequency contour information and capturing fine contour details which can lead to bias while predicting the portrait's contours. To deal with this issue we propose EFormer to enhance the model's attention towards both the low-frequency semantic and high-frequency contour features. For the high-frequency contours our research demonstrates that cross-attention module between different resolutions can guide our model to allocate attention appropriately to these contour regions. Supported by this we can successfully extract the high-frequency detail information around the portrait's contours which were previously ignored by self-attention. Based on the cross-attention module we further build a semantic and contour detector (SCD) to accurately capture both the low-frequency semantic and high-frequency contour features. And we design a contour-edge extraction branch and semantic extraction branch to extract refined high-frequency contour features and complete low-frequency semantic information respectively. Finally we fuse the two kinds of features and leverage the segmentation head to generate a predicted portrait matte. Experiments on VideoMatte240K (JPEG SD Format) and Adobe Image Matting (AIM) datasets demonstrate that EFormer outperforms previous portrait matte methods.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_EFormer_Enhanced_Transformer_towards_Semantic-Contour_Features_of_Foreground_for_Portraits_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
MultiPly: Reconstruction of Multiple People from Monocular Video in the Wild,"Jiang, Zeren, Guo, Chen, Kaufmann, Manuel, Jiang, Tianjian, Valentin, Julien, Hilliges, Otmar, Song, Jie",We present MultiPly a novel framework to reconstruct multiple people in 3D from monocular in-the-wild videos. Reconstructing multiple individuals moving and interacting naturally from monocular in-the-wild videos poses a challenging task. Addressing it necessitates precise pixel-level disentanglement of individuals without any prior knowledge about the subjects. Moreover it requires recovering intricate and complete 3D human shapes from short video sequences intensifying the level of difficulty. To tackle these challenges we first define a layered neural representation for the entire scene composited by individual human and background models. We learn the layered neural representation from videos via our layer-wise differentiable volume rendering. This learning process is further enhanced by our hybrid instance segmentation approach which combines the self-supervised 3D segmentation and the promptable 2D segmentation module yielding reliable instance segmentation supervision even under close human interaction. A confidence-guided optimization formulation is introduced to optimize the human poses and shape/appearance alternately. We incorporate effective objectives to refine human poses via photometric information and impose physically plausible constraints on human dynamics leading to temporally consistent 3D reconstructions with high fidelity. The evaluation of our method shows the superiority over prior art on publicly available datasets and in-the-wild videos.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jiang_MultiPly_Reconstruction_of_Multiple_People_from_Monocular_Video_in_the_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ConsistNet: Enforcing 3D Consistency for Multi-view Images Diffusion,"Yang, Jiayu, Cheng, Ziang, Duan, Yunfei, Ji, Pan, Li, Hongdong",Given a single image of a 3D object this paper proposes a novel method (named ConsistNet) that can generate multiple images of the same object as if they are captured from different viewpoints while the 3D (multi-view) consistencies among those multiple generated images are effectively exploited. Central to our method is a lightweight multi-view consistency block that enables information exchange across multiple single-view diffusion processes based on the underlying multi-view geometry principles. ConsistNet is an extension to the standard latent diffusion model and it consists of two submodules: (a) a view aggregation module that unprojects multi-view features into global 3D volumes and infers consistency and (b) a ray aggregation module that samples and aggregates 3D consistent features back to each view to enforce consistency. Our approach departs from previous methods in multi-view image generation in that it can be easily dropped in pre-trained LDMs without requiring explicit pixel correspondences or depth prediction. Experiments show that our method effectively learns 3D consistency over a frozen Zero123-XL backbone and can generate 16 surrounding views of the object within 11 seconds on a single A100 GPU.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yang_ConsistNet_Enforcing_3D_Consistency_for_Multi-view_Images_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
GenN2N: Generative NeRF2NeRF Translation,"Liu, Xiangyue, Xue, Han, Luo, Kunming, Tan, Ping, Yi, Li",We present GenN2N a unified NeRF-to-NeRF translation framework for various NeRF translation tasks such as text-driven NeRF editing colorization super-resolution inpainting etc. Unlike previous methods designed for individual translation tasks with task-specific schemes GenN2N achieves all these NeRF editing tasks by employing a plug-and-play image-to-image translator to perform editing in the 2D domain and lifting 2D edits into the 3D NeRF space. Since the 3D consistency of 2D edits may not be assured we propose to model the distribution of the underlying 3D edits through a generative model that can cover all possible edited NeRFs. To model the distribution of 3D edited NeRFs from 2D edited images we carefully design a VAE-GAN that encodes images while decoding NeRFs. The latent space is trained to align with a Gaussian distribution and the NeRFs are supervised through an adversarial loss on its renderings. To ensure the latent code does not depend on 2D viewpoints but truly reflects the 3D edits we also regularize the latent code through a contrastive learning scheme. Extensive experiments on various editing tasks show GenN2N as a universal framework performs as well or better than task-specific specialists while possessing flexible generative power.

Universal Robustness via Median Randomized Smoothing for Real-World Super-Resolution,"Chaouai, Zakariya, Tamaazousti, Mohamed",Most of the recent literature on image Super-Resolution (SR) can be classified into two main approaches. The first one involves learning a corruption model tailored to a specific dataset aiming to mimic the noise and corruption in low-resolution images such as sensor noise. However this approach is data-specific tends to lack adaptability and its accuracy diminishes when faced with unseen types of image corruptions. A second and more recent approach referred to as Robust Super-Resolution (RSR) proposes to improve real-world SR by harnessing the generalization capabilities of a model by making it robust to adversarial attacks. To delve further into this second approach our paper explores the universality of various methods for enhancing the robustness of deep learning SR models. In other words we inquire: \enquote Which robustness method exhibits the highest degree of adaptability when dealing with a wide range of adversarial attacks ? . Our extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world images empirically demonstrates that median randomized smoothing (MRS) is more general in terms of robustness compared to adversarial learning techniques which tend to focus on specific types of attacks. Furthermore as expected we also illustrate that the proposed universal robust method enables the SR model to handle standard corruptions more effectively such as blur and Gaussian noise and notably corruptions naturally present in real-world images. These results support the significance of shifting the paradigm in the development of real-world SR methods towards RSR especially via MRS.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chaouai_Universal_Robustness_via_Median_Randomized_Smoothing_for_Real-World_Super-Resolution_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
One-dimensional Adapter to Rule Them All: Concepts Diffusion Models and Erasing Applications,"Lyu, Mengyao, Yang, Yuhong, Hong, Haiwen, Chen, Hui, Jin, Xuan, He, Yuan, Xue, Hui, Han, Jungong, Ding, Guiguang",The prevalent use of commercial and open-source diffusion models (DMs) for text-to-image generation prompts risk mitigation to prevent undesired behaviors. Existing concept erasing methods in academia are all based on full parameter or specification-based fine-tuning from which we observe the following issues: 1) Generation alteration towards erosion: Parameter drift during target elimination causes alterations and potential deformations across all generations even eroding other concepts at varying degrees which is more evident with multi-concept erased; 2) Transfer inability & deployment inefficiency: Previous model-specific erasure impedes the flexible combination of concepts and the training-free transfer towards other models resulting in linear cost growth as the deployment scenarios increase. To achieve non-invasive precise customizable and transferable elimination we ground our erasing framework on one-dimensional adapters to erase multiple concepts from most DMs at once across versatile erasing applications. The concept-SemiPermeable structure is injected as a Membrane (SPM) into any DM to learn targeted erasing and meantime the alteration and erosion phenomenon is effectively mitigated via a novel Latent Anchoring fine-tuning strategy. Once obtained SPMs can be flexibly combined and plug-and-play for other DMs without specific re-tuning enabling timely and efficient adaptation to diverse scenarios. During generation our Facilitated Transport mechanism dynamically regulates the permeability of each SPM to respond to different input prompts further minimizing the impact on other concepts. Quantitative and qualitative results across  40 concepts 7 DMs and 4 erasing applications have demonstrated the superior erasing of SPM. Our code and pre-tuned SPMs are available on the project page https://lyumengyao.github.io/projects/spm.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lyu_One-dimensional_Adapter_to_Rule_Them_All_Concepts_Diffusion_Models_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Kandinsky Conformal Prediction: Efficient Calibration of Image Segmentation Algorithms,"Brunekreef, Joren, Marcus, Eric, Sheombarsing, Ray, Sonke, Jan-Jakob, Teuwen, Jonas","Image segmentation algorithms can be understood as a collection of pixel classifiers for which the outcomes of nearby pixels are correlated. Classifier models can be calibrated using Inductive Conformal Prediction but this requires holding back a sufficiently large calibration dataset for computing the distribution of non-conformity scores of the model's predictions. If one only requires only marginal calibration on the image level this calibration set consists of all individual pixels in the images available for calibration. However if the goal is to attain proper calibration for each individual pixel classifier the calibration set consists of individual images. In a scenario where data are scarce (such as the medical domain) it may not always be possible to set aside sufficiently many images for this pixel-level calibration.The method we propose dubbed ""Kandinsky calibration"" makes use of the spatial structure present in the distribution of natural images to simultaneously calibrate the classifiers of ""similar"" pixels. This can be seen as an intermediate approach between marginal (imagewise) and conditional (pixelwise) calibration where non-conformity scores are aggregated over similar image regions thereby making more efficient use of the images available for calibration. We run experiments on segmentation algorithms trained and calibrated on subsets of the public MS-COCO and Medical Decathlon datasets demonstrating that Kandinsky calibration method can significantly improve the coverage. When compared to both pixelwise and imagewise calibration on little data the Kandinsky method achieves much lower coverage errors indicating the data efficiency of the Kandinsky calibration.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Brunekreef_Kandinsky_Conformal_Prediction_Efficient_Calibration_of_Image_Segmentation_Algorithms_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Diversity-aware Channel Pruning for StyleGAN Compression,"Chung, Jiwoo, Hyun, Sangeek, Shim, Sang-Heon, Heo, Jae-Pil",StyleGAN has shown remarkable performance in unconditional image generation. However its high computational cost poses a significant challenge for practical applications. Although recent efforts have been made to compress StyleGAN while preserving its performance existing compressed models still lag behind the original model particularly in terms of sample diversity. To overcome this we propose a novel channel pruning method that leverages varying sensitivities of channels to latent vectors which is a key factor in sample diversity. Specifically by assessing channel importance based on their sensitivities to latent vector perturbations our method enhances the diversity of samples in the compressed model. Since our method solely focuses on the channel pruning stage it has complementary benefits with prior training schemes without additional training cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances sample diversity across various datasets. Moreover in terms of FID scores our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art by a large margin but also achieves comparable scores with only half training iterations.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chung_Diversity-aware_Channel_Pruning_for_StyleGAN_Compression_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Neural Clustering based Visual Representation Learning,"Chen, Guikun, Li, Xia, Yang, Yi, Wang, Wenguan",We investigate a fundamental aspect of machine vision: the measurement of features by revisiting clustering one of the most classic approaches in machine learning and data analysis. Existing visual feature extractors including ConvNets ViTs and MLPs represent an image as rectangular regions. Though prevalent such a grid-style paradigm is built upon engineering practice and lacks explicit modeling of data distribution. In this work we propose feature extraction with clustering (FEC) a conceptually elegant yet surprisingly ad-hoc interpretable neural clustering framework which views feature extraction as a process of selecting representatives from data and thus automatically captures the underlying data distribution. Given an image FEC alternates between grouping pixels into individual clusters to abstract representatives and updating the deep features of pixels with current representatives. Such an iterative working mechanism is implemented in the form of several neural layers and the final representatives can be used for downstream tasks. The cluster assignments across layers which can be viewed and inspected by humans make the forward process of FEC fully transparent and empower it with promising ad-hoc interpretability. Extensive experiments on various visual recognition models and tasks verify the effectiveness generality and interpretability of FEC. We expect this work will provoke a rethink of the current de facto grid-style paradigm.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Neural_Clustering_based_Visual_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Sparse Semi-DETR: Sparse Learnable Queries for Semi-Supervised Object Detection,"Shehzadi, Tahira, Hashmi, Khurram Azeem, Stricker, Didier, Afzal, Muhammad Zeshan",In this paper we address the limitations of the DETR-based semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) framework particularly focusing on the challenges posed by the quality of object queries. In DETR-based SSOD the one-to-one assignment strategy provides inaccurate pseudo-labels while the one-to-many assignments strategy leads to overlapping predictions. These issues compromise training efficiency and degrade model performance especially in detecting small or occluded objects. We introduce Sparse Semi-DETR a novel transformer-based end-to-end semi-supervised object detection solution to overcome these challenges. Sparse Semi-DETR incorporates a Query Refinement Module to enhance the quality of object queries significantly improving detection capabilities for small and partially obscured objects. Additionally we integrate a Reliable Pseudo-Label Filtering Module that selectively filters high-quality pseudo-labels thereby enhancing detection accuracy and consistency. On the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC object detection benchmarks Sparse Semi-DETR achieves a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods that highlight Sparse Semi-DETR's effectiveness in semi-supervised object detection particularly in challenging scenarios involving small or partially obscured objects.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shehzadi_Sparse_Semi-DETR_Sparse_Learnable_Queries_for_Semi-Supervised_Object_Detection_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Uncertainty-Aware Source-Free Adaptive Image Super-Resolution with Wavelet Augmentation Transformer,"Ai, Yuang, Zhou, Xiaoqiang, Huang, Huaibo, Zhang, Lei, He, Ran",Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) can effectively address domain gap issues in real-world image Super-Resolution (SR) by accessing both the source and target data. Considering privacy policies or transmission restrictions of source data in practical scenarios we propose a SOurce-free Domain Adaptation framework for image SR (SODA-SR) to address this issue i.e. adapt a source-trained model to a target domain with only unlabeled target data. SODA-SR leverages the source-trained model to generate refined pseudo-labels for teacher-student learning. To better utilize pseudo-labels we propose a novel wavelet-based augmentation method named Wavelet Augmentation Transformer (WAT) which can be flexibly incorporated with existing networks to implicitly produce useful augmented data. WAT learns low-frequency information of varying levels across diverse samples which is aggregated efficiently via deformable attention. Furthermore an uncertainty-aware self-training mechanism is proposed to improve the accuracy of pseudo-labels with inaccurate predictions being rectified by uncertainty estimation. To acquire better SR results and avoid overfitting pseudo-labels several regularization losses are proposed to constrain target LR and SR images in the frequency domain. Experiments show that without accessing source data SODA-SR outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods in both synthetic->real and real->real adaptation settings and is not constrained by specific network architectures.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ai_Uncertainty-Aware_Source-Free_Adaptive_Image_Super-Resolution_with_Wavelet_Augmentation_Transformer_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Spacetime Gaussian Feature Splatting for Real-Time Dynamic View Synthesis,"Li, Zhan, Chen, Zhang, Li, Zhong, Xu, Yi",Novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes has been an intriguing yet challenging problem. Despite recent advancements simultaneously achieving high-resolution photorealistic results real-time rendering and compact storage remains a formidable task. To address these challenges we propose Spacetime Gaussian Feature Splatting as a novel dynamic scene representation composed of three pivotal components. First we formulate expressive Spacetime Gaussians by enhancing 3D Gaussians with temporal opacity and parametric motion/rotation. This enables Spacetime Gaussians to capture static dynamic as well as transient content within a scene. Second we introduce splatted feature rendering which replaces spherical harmonics with neural features. These features facilitate the modeling of view- and time-dependent appearance while maintaining small size. Third we leverage the guidance of training error and coarse depth to sample new Gaussians in areas that are challenging to converge with existing pipelines. Experiments on several established real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and speed while retaining compact storage. At 8K resolution our lite-version model can render at 60 FPS on an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_Spacetime_Gaussian_Feature_Splatting_for_Real-Time_Dynamic_View_Synthesis_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Instruct-Imagen: Image Generation with Multi-modal Instruction,"Hu, Hexiang, Chan, Kelvin C.K., Su, Yu-Chuan, Chen, Wenhu, Li, Yandong, Sohn, Kihyuk, Zhao, Yang, Ben, Xue, Gong, Boqing, Cohen, William, Chang, Ming-Wei, Jia, Xuhui",This paper presents Instruct-Imagen a model that tackles heterogeneous image generation tasks and generalizes across unseen tasks. We introduce multi-modal instruction for image generation a task representation articulating a range of generation intents with precision. It uses natural language to amalgamate disparate modalities (e.g. text edge style subject etc.) such that abundant generation intents can be standardized in a uniform format. We then build Instruct-Imagen by fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with two stages. First we adapt the model using the retrieval-augmented training to enhance model's capabilities to ground its generation on external multi-modal context. Subsequently we fine-tune the adapted model on diverse image generation tasks that requires vision-language understanding (e.g. subject-driven generation etc.) each paired with a multi-modal instruction encapsulating the task's essence. Human evaluation on various image generation datasets reveals that Instruct-Imagen matches or surpasses prior task-specific models in-domain and demonstrates promising generalization to unseen and more complex tasks. Our evaluation suite will be made publicly available.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hu_Instruct-Imagen_Image_Generation_with_Multi-modal_Instruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Rethinking Few-shot 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"An, Zhaochong, Sun, Guolei, Liu, Yun, Liu, Fayao, Wu, Zongwei, Wang, Dan, Van Gool, Luc, Belongie, Serge",This paper revisits few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (FS-PCS) with a focus on two significant issues in the state-of-the-art: foreground leakage and sparse point distribution. The former arises from non-uniform point sampling allowing models to distinguish the density disparities between foreground and background for easier segmentation. The latter results from sampling only 2048 points limiting semantic information and deviating from the real-world practice. To address these issues we introduce a standardized FS-PCS setting upon which a new benchmark is built. Moreover we propose a novel FS-PCS model. While previous methods are based on feature optimization by mainly refining support features to enhance prototypes our method is based on correlation optimization referred to as Correlation Optimization Segmentation (COSeg). Specifically we compute Class-specific Multi-prototypical Correlation (CMC) for each query point representing its correlations to category prototypes. Then we propose the Hyper Correlation Augmentation (HCA) module to enhance CMC. Furthermore tackling the inherent property of few-shot training to incur base susceptibility for models we propose to learn non-parametric prototypes for the base classes during training. The learned base prototypes are used to calibrate correlations for the background class through a Base Prototypes Calibration (BPC) module. Experiments on popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of COSeg over existing methods. The code is available at github.com/ZhaochongAn/COSeg.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/An_Rethinking_Few-shot_3D_Point_Cloud_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
GreedyViG: Dynamic Axial Graph Construction for Efficient Vision GNNs,"Munir, Mustafa, Avery, William, Rahman, Md Mostafijur, Marculescu, Radu",Vision graph neural networks (ViG) offer a new avenue for exploration in computer vision. A major bottleneck in ViGs is the inefficient k-nearest neighbor (KNN) operation used for graph construction. To solve this issue we propose a new method for designing ViGs Dynamic Axial Graph Construction (DAGC) which is more efficient than KNN as it limits the number of considered graph connections made within an image. Additionally we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture GreedyViG which uses DAGC. Extensive experiments show that GreedyViG beats existing ViG CNN and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy GMACs and parameters on image classification object detection instance segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model GreedyViG-S achieves 81.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K 2.9% higher than Vision GNN and 2.2% higher than Vision HyperGraph Neural Network (ViHGNN) with less GMACs and a similar number of parameters. Our largest model GreedyViG-B obtains 83.9% top-1 accuracy 0.2% higher than Vision GNN with a 66.6% decrease in parameters and a 69% decrease in GMACs. GreedyViG-B also obtains the same accuracy as ViHGNN with a 67.3% decrease in parameters and a 71.3% decrease in GMACs. Our work shows that hybrid CNN-GNN architectures not only provide a new avenue for designing efficient models but that they can also exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art models.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Munir_GreedyViG_Dynamic_Axial_Graph_Construction_for_Efficient_Vision_GNNs_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Relightable and Animatable Neural Avatar from Sparse-View Video,"Xu, Zhen, Peng, Sida, Geng, Chen, Mou, Linzhan, Yan, Zihan, Sun, Jiaming, Bao, Hujun, Zhou, Xiaowei",This paper tackles the problem of creating relightable and animatable neural avatars from sparse-view (or monocular) videos of dynamic humans under unknown illumination. Previous neural human reconstruction methods produce animatable avatars from sparse views using deformed Signed Distance Fields (SDF) but are non-relightable. While differentiable inverse rendering methods have succeeded in the material recovery of static objects it is not straightforward to extend them to dynamic humans since it is computationally intensive to compute pixel-surface intersection and light visibility on deformed SDFs for relighting. To solve this challenge we propose a Hierarchical Distance Query (HDQ) algorithm to approximate the world space SDF under arbitrary human poses. Specifically we estimate coarse SDF based on a parametric human model and compute fine SDF by exploiting the invariance of SDF w.r.t. local deformation. Based on HDQ we leverage sphere tracing to efficiently estimate the surface intersection and light visibility. This allows us to develop the first system to recover relightable and animatable neural avatars from sparse or monocular inputs. Experiments show that our approach produces superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at https://zju3dv.github.io/relightable_avatar.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_Relightable_and_Animatable_Neural_Avatar_from_Sparse-View_Video_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
Pose Adapted Shape Learning for Large-Pose Face Reenactment,"Hsu, Gee-Sern Jison, Zhang, Jie-Ying, Hsiang, Huang Yu, Hong, Wei-Jie",We propose the Pose Adapted Shape Learning (PASL) for large-pose face reenactment. The PASL framework consists of three modules namely the Pose-Adapted face Encoder (PAE) the Cycle-consistent Shape Generator (CSG) and the Attention-Embedded Generator (AEG). Different from previous approaches that use a single face encoder for identity preservation we propose multiple Pose-Adapted face Encodes (PAEs) to better preserve facial identity across large poses. Given a source face and a reference face the CSG generates a recomposed shape that fuses the source identity and reference action in the shape space and meets the cycle consistency requirement. Taking the shape code and the source as inputs the AEG learns the attention within the shape code and between the shape code and source style to enhance the generation of the desired target face. As existing benchmark datasets are inappropriate for evaluating large-pose face reenactment we propose a scheme to compose large-pose face pairs and introduce the MPIE-LP (Large Pose) and VoxCeleb2-LP datasets as the new large-pose benchmarks. We compared our approach with state-of-the-art methods on MPIE-LP and VoxCeleb2-LP for large-pose performance and on VoxCeleb1 for the common scope of pose variation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hsu_Pose_Adapted_Shape_Learning_for_Large-Pose_Face_Reenactment_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
NRDF: Neural Riemannian Distance Fields for Learning Articulated Pose Priors,"He, Yannan, Tiwari, Garvita, Birdal, Tolga, Lenssen, Jan Eric, Pons-Moll, Gerard",Faithfully modeling the space of articulations is a crucial task that allows recovery and generation of realistic poses and remains a notorious challenge. To this end we introduce Neural Riemannian Distance Fields (NRDFs) data-driven priors modeling the space of plausible articulations represented as the zero-level-set of a neural field in a high-dimensional product-quaternion space. To train NRDFs only on positive examples we introduce a new sampling algorithm ensuring that the geodesic distances follow a desired distribution yielding a principled distance field learning paradigm. We then devise a projection algorithm to map any random pose onto the level-set by an adaptive-step Riemannian optimizer adhering to the product manifold of joint rotations at all times. NRDFs can compute the Riemannian gradient via backpropagation and by mathematical analogy are related to Riemannian flow matching a recent generative model. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of NRDF against other pose priors in various downstream tasks i.e. pose generation image-based pose estimation and solving inverse kinematics highlighting NRDF's superior performance. Besides humans NRDF's versatility extends to hand and animal poses as it can effectively represent any articulation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/He_NRDF_Neural_Riemannian_Distance_Fields_for_Learning_Articulated_Pose_Priors_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
RepAn: Enhanced Annealing through Re-parameterization,"Fei, Xiang, Zheng, Xiawu, Wang, Yan, Chao, Fei, Wu, Chenglin, Cao, Liujuan",The simulated annealing algorithm aims to improve model convergence through multiple restarts of training. However existing annealing algorithms overlook the correlation between different cycles neglecting the potential for incremental learning. We contend that a fixed network structure prevents the model from recognizing distinct features at different training stages. To this end we propose RepAn redesigning the irreversible re-parameterization (Rep) method and integrating it with annealing to enhance training. Specifically the network goes through Rep expansion restoration and backpropagation operations during training and iterating through these processes in each annealing round. Such a method exhibits good generalization and is easy to apply and we provide theoretical explanations for its effectiveness. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves baseline performance by 6.38% on the CIFAR-100 dataset and 2.80% on ImageNet achieving state-of-the-art performance in the Rep field.

DreamControl: Control-Based Text-to-3D Generation with 3D Self-Prior,"Huang, Tianyu, Zeng, Yihan, Zhang, Zhilu, Xu, Wan, Xu, Hang, Xu, Songcen, Lau, Rynson W.H., Zuo, Wangmeng",3D generation has raised great attention in recent years. With the success of text-to-image diffusion models the 2D-lifting technique becomes a promising route to controllable 3D generation. However these methods tend to present inconsistent geometry which is also known as the Janus problem. We observe that the problem is caused mainly by two aspects i.e. viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion models and overfitting of the optimization objective. To address it we propose a two-stage 2D-lifting framework namely DreamControl which optimizes coarse NeRF scenes as 3D self-prior and then generates fine-grained objects with control-based score distillation. Specifically adaptive viewpoint sampling and boundary integrity metric are proposed to ensure the consistency of generated priors. The priors are then regarded as input conditions to maintain reasonable geometries in which conditional LoRA and weighted score are further proposed to optimize detailed textures. DreamControl can generate high-quality 3D content in terms of both geometry consistency and texture fidelity. Moreover our control-based optimization guidance is applicable to more downstream tasks including user-guided generation and 3D animation.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Huang_DreamControl_Control-Based_Text-to-3D_Generation_with_3D_Self-Prior_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
ODIN: A Single Model for 2D and 3D Segmentation,"Jain, Ayush, Katara, Pushkal, Gkanatsios, Nikolaos, Harley, Adam W., Sarch, Gabriel, Aggarwal, Kriti, Chaudhary, Vishrav, Fragkiadaki, Katerina",State-of-the-art models on contemporary 3D segmentation benchmarks like ScanNet consume and label dataset-provided 3D point clouds obtained through post processing of sensed multiview RGB-D images. They are typically trained in-domain forego large-scale 2D pre-training and outperform alternatives that featurize the posed RGB-D multiview images instead. The gap in performance between methods that consume posed images versus post-processed 3D point clouds has fueled the belief that 2D and 3D perception require distinct model architectures. In this paper we challenge this view and propose ODIN (Omni-Dimensional INstance segmentation) a model that can segment and label both 2D RGB images and 3D point clouds using a transformer architecture that alternates between 2D within-view and 3D cross-view information fusion. Our model differentiates 2D and 3D feature operations through the positional encodings of the tokens involved which capture pixel coordinates for 2D patch tokens and 3D coordinates for 3D feature tokens. ODIN achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 Matterport3D and AI2THOR 3D instance segmentation benchmarks and competitive performance on ScanNet S3DIS and COCO. It outperforms all previous works by a wide margin when the sensed 3D point cloud is used in place of the point cloud sampled from 3D mesh. When used as the 3D perception engine in an instructable embodied agent architecture it sets a new state-of-the-art on the TEACh action-from-dialogue benchmark.

InitNO: Boosting Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Initial Noise Optimization,"Guo, Xiefan, Liu, Jinlin, Cui, Miaomiao, Li, Jiankai, Yang, Hongyu, Huang, Di",Recent strides in the development of diffusion models exemplified by advancements such as Stable Diffusion have underscored their remarkable prowess in generating visually compelling images. However the imperative of achieving a seamless alignment between the generated image and the provided prompt persists as a formidable challenge. This paper traces the root of these difficulties to invalid initial noise and proposes a solution in the form of Initial Noise Optimization (InitNO) a paradigm that refines this noise. Considering text prompts not all random noises are effective in synthesizing semantically-faithful images. We design the cross-attention response score and the self-attention conflict score to evaluate the initial noise bifurcating the initial latent space into valid and invalid sectors. A strategically crafted noise optimization pipeline is developed to guide the initial noise towards valid regions. Our method validated through rigorous experimentation shows a commendable proficiency in generating images in strict accordance with text prompts.

Multimodal Sense-Informed Forecasting of 3D Human Motions,"Lou, Zhenyu, Cui, Qiongjie, Wang, Haofan, Tang, Xu, Zhou, Hong",Predicting future human pose is a fundamental application for machine intelligence which drives robots to plan their behavior and paths ahead of time to seamlessly accomplish human-robot collaboration in real-world 3D scenarios. Despite encouraging results existing approaches rarely consider the effects of the external scene on the motion sequence leading to pronounced artifacts and physical implausibilities in the predictions. To address this limitation this work introduces a novel multi-modal sense-informed motion prediction approach which conditions high-fidelity generation on two modal information: external 3D scene and internal human gaze and is able to recognize their salience for future human activity. Furthermore the gaze information is regarded as the human intention and combined with both motion and scene features we construct a ternary intention-aware attention to supervise the generation to match where the human wants to reach. Meanwhile we introduce semantic coherence-aware attention to explicitly distinguish the salient point clouds and the underlying ones to ensure a reasonable interaction of the generated sequence with the 3D scene. On two real-world benchmarks the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance both in 3D human pose and trajectory prediction.

FlowerFormer: Empowering Neural Architecture Encoding using a Flow-aware Graph Transformer,"Hwang, Dongyeong, Kim, Hyunju, Kim, Sunwoo, Shin, Kijung",The success of a specific neural network architecture is closely tied to the dataset and task it tackles; there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Thus considerable efforts have been made to quickly and accurately estimate the performances of neural architectures without full training or evaluation for given tasks and datasets. Neural architecture encoding has played a crucial role in the estimation and graphbased methods which treat an architecture as a graph have shown prominent performance. For enhanced representation learning of neural architectures we introduce FlowerFormer a powerful graph transformer that incorporates the information flows within a neural architecture. FlowerFormer consists of two key components: (a) bidirectional asynchronous message passing inspired by the flows; (b) global attention built on flow-based masking.

EmoGen: Emotional Image Content Generation with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Yang, Jingyuan, Feng, Jiawei, Huang, Hui",Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in image generation task where users can create visually astonishing images with high-quality. However exsiting text-to-image diffusion models are proficient in generating concrete concepts (dogs) but encounter challenges with more abstract ones (emotions). Several efforts have been made to modify image emotions with color and style adjustments facing limitations in effectively conveying emotions with fixed image contents. In this work we introduce Emotional Image Content Generation (EIGC) a new task to generate semantic-clear and emotion-faithful images given emotion categories. Specifically we propose an emotion space and construct a mapping network to align it with powerful Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) space providing a concrete interpretation of abstract emotions. Attribute loss and emotion confidence are further proposed to ensure the semantic diversity and emotion fidelity of the generated images. Our method outperforms the state-the-art text-to-image approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively where we derive three custom metrics i.e.emotion accuracy semantic clarity and semantic diversity. In addition to generation our method can help emotion understanding and inspire emotional art design.

Neural Implicit Representation for Building Digital Twins of Unknown Articulated Objects,"Weng, Yijia, Wen, Bowen, Tremblay, Jonathan, Blukis, Valts, Fox, Dieter, Guibas, Leonidas, Birchfield, Stan",We address the problem of building digital twins of unknown articulated objects from two RGBD scans of the object at different articulation states. We decompose the problem into two stages each addressing distinct aspects. Our method first reconstructs object-level shape at each state then recovers the underlying articulation model including part segmentation and joint articulations that associate the two states. By explicitly modeling point-level correspondences and exploiting cues from images 3D reconstructions and kinematics our method yields more accurate and stable results compared to prior work. It also handles more than one movable part and does not rely on any object shape or structure priors.

Vanishing-Point-Guided Video Semantic Segmentation of Driving Scenes,"Guo, Diandian, Fan, Deng-Ping, Lu, Tongyu, Sakaridis, Christos, Van Gool, Luc",The estimation of implicit cross-frame correspondences and the high computational cost have long been major challenges in video semantic segmentation (VSS) for driving scenes. Prior works utilize keyframes feature propagation or cross-frame attention to address these issues. By contrast we are the first to harness vanishing point (VP) priors for more effective segmentation. Intuitively objects near VPs (i.e. away from the vehicle) are less discernible. Moreover they tend to move radially away from the VP over time in the usual case of a forward-facing camera a straight road and linear forward motion of the vehicle. Our novel efficient network for VSS named VPSeg incorporates two modules that utilize exactly this pair of static and dynamic VP priors: sparse-to-dense feature mining (DenseVP) and VP-guided motion fusion (MotionVP). MotionVP employs VP-guided motion estimation to establish explicit correspondences across frames and help attend to the most relevant features from neighboring frames while DenseVP enhances weak dynamic features in distant regions around VPs. These modules operate within a context-detail framework which separates contextual features from high-resolution local features at different input resolutions to reduce computational costs. Contextual and local features are integrated through contextualized motion attention (CMA) for the final prediction. Extensive experiments on two popular driving segmentation benchmarks Cityscapes and ACDC demonstrate that VPSeg outperforms previous SOTA methods with only modest computational overhead.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Guo_Vanishing-Point-Guided_Video_Semantic_Segmentation_of_Driving_Scenes_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
LAMP: Learn A Motion Pattern for Few-Shot Video Generation,"Wu, Ruiqi, Chen, Liangyu, Yang, Tong, Guo, Chunle, Li, Chongyi, Zhang, Xiangyu",In this paper we present a few-shot text-to-video framework LAMP which enables a text-to-image diffusion model to Learn A specific Motion Pattern with 8 16 videos on a single GPU. Unlike existing methods which require a large number of training resources or learn motions that are precisely aligned with template videos it achieves a trade-off between the degree of generation freedom and the resource costs for model training. Specifically we design a motion-content decoupled pipeline that uses an off-the-shelf text-to-image model for content generation so that our tuned video diffusion model mainly focuses on motion learning. The well-developed text-to-image techniques can provide visually pleasing and diverse content as generation conditions which highly improves video quality and generation freedom. To capture the features of temporal dimension we expand the pre-trained 2D convolution layers of the T2I model to our novel temporal-spatial motion learning layers and modify the attention blocks to the temporal level. Additionally we develop an effective inference trick shared-noise sampling which can improve the stability of videos without computational costs. Our method can also be flexibly applied to other tasks e.g. real-world image animation and video editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAMP can effectively learn the motion pattern on limited data and generate high-quality videos.

Language-driven Object Fusion into Neural Radiance Fields with Pose-Conditioned Dataset Updates,"Shum, Ka Chun, Kim, Jaeyeon, Hua, Binh-Son, Nguyen, Duc Thanh, Yeung, Sai-Kit",Neural radiance field (NeRF) is an emerging technique for 3D scene reconstruction and modeling. However current NeRF-based methods are limited in the capabilities of adding or removing objects. This paper fills the aforementioned gap by proposing a new language-driven method for object manipulation in NeRFs through dataset updates. Specifically to insert an object represented by a set of multi-view images into a background NeRF we use a text-to-image diffusion model to blend the object into the given background across views. The generated images are then used to update the NeRF so that we can render view-consistent images of the object within the background. To ensure view consistency we propose a dataset update strategy that prioritizes the radiance field training based on camera poses in a pose-ordered manner. We validate our method in two case studies: object insertion and object removal. Experimental results show that our method can generate photo-realistic results and achieves state-of-the-art performance in NeRF editing.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shum_Language-driven_Object_Fusion_into_Neural_Radiance_Fields_with_Pose-Conditioned_Dataset_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
DREAM: Diffusion Rectification and Estimation-Adaptive Models,"Zhou, Jinxin, Ding, Tianyu, Chen, Tianyi, Jiang, Jiachen, Zharkov, Ilya, Zhu, Zhihui, Liang, Luming",We present DREAM a novel training framework representing Diffusion Rectification and Estimation-Adaptive Models requiring minimal code changes (just three lines) yet significantly enhancing the alignment of training with sampling in diffusion models. DREAM features two components: diffusion rectification which adjusts training to reflect the sampling process and estimation adaptation which balances perception against distortion. When applied to image super-resolution (SR) DREAM adeptly navigates the tradeoff between minimizing distortion and preserving high image quality. Experiments demonstrate DREAM's superiority over standard diffusion-based SR methods showing a to faster training convergence and a to reduction in necessary sampling steps to achieve comparable or superior results. We hope DREAM will inspire a rethinking of diffusion model training paradigms.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_DREAM_Diffusion_Rectification_and_Estimation-Adaptive_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
